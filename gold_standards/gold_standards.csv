Each recipient can collect once a day up to three times a week. The amount covers bus fare from the participants area to the disbursement point. To get the subsidy, job-seekers need to front the cash to make the initial journey. The start and end time of the subsidy is staggered for logistical reasons to generate variation across individuals during which the treatment is available.

Job application workshop: The job application workshop contains two components, an orientation session and a certification session. On the first day, participants take a series of personnel selection tests. On the second day, they attend the orientation session. The orientation session covers CV writing, application letters and job interviews. The certification session includes four tests: (i) a Raven matrices test, (ii) a test of linguistic ability in Amharic, (iii) a test of mathematical ability and (iv) a ‘work-sample’ test.","Individuals in this treatment group are offered a subsidy to cover the cost of traveling to the city centre. The subsidy takes the form of a cash transfer that is conditional on visiting a disbursement point, located in an office in the centre of Addis Ababa.12 Recipients are required to attend in person, and to show photographic ID on each visit. Each recipient can collect cash once a day, up to three times a week. The daily amount is sufficient to cover the cost of a return bus fare from the participant’s area of residence at baseline to the disbursement point.13 To access the subsidy, job-seekers need to have (or borrow) enough cash to make the first journey – which in our setting is almost always the case.","For logistical reasons, we stagger the start time and the end time of the subsidy, randomly. This generates variation across individuals in the number of weeks during which the treatment is available, and in the time of treatment.",The intervention has two components: an orientation session and a certification session,"The intervention takes place over two days.

* Ashwagandha may not be safe, espcially in the long term (since most studies on it have been of short duration)
* These findings may not generalize to alternative ashwagandha extracts with varying quality","The sample size recruited was small, making it difficult to develop definitive conclusions. Future studies should, therefore, involve larger samples. Participants were recruited via social media, which may have biased the findings. It is expected that such individuals comprise a motivated cohort of volunteers. Consequently, in addition to participating in a study and taking supplements, these individuals may have made dietary, occupational, lifestyle, and/or social changes that contributed to the fatigue-lowering and vigor-enhancing changes observed in both treatment conditions. While participants were encouraged to maintain regular lifestyle habits during the study, this was not adequately monitored. It may be beneficial in future studies to monitor such changes (e.g., diet, exercise, weight, life stressors) through questionnaires and other monitoring instruments. It is also important to consider the potential impact of participant expectations. This is particularly important when there are strong advertising campaigns promoting the virtues of a product or drug. In the sample of Australian participants recruited in this study, most reported limited knowledge about ashwagandha and its benefits. However, this will require consideration in countries such as India and increasingly in the United States, where knowledge about ashwagandha by healthconscious individuals is increasing.","To increase compliance and reduce the demands on participants, hormonal concentrations were evaluated via fasting salivary collections rather than in serum. It has been confirmed in several studies that salivary measurements of testosterone, DHEA-S, cortisol, and estradiol correlate well with serum levels (Arregger, Contreras, Tumilasci, Aquilano, & Cardoso, 2007; Francavilla et al., 2018; Lood et al., 2018). However, their accuracy as an   outcome measure can be compromised by their rapid diurnal variability (Wood, 2009). Although participants were instructed to collect saliva samples within 15 min of waking, and in a fasting state, sample collection times could not be adequately monitored as they were undertaken in participants’ homes. Inconsistency in such collections will have a negative impact on the accuracy and reliability of measurements. In future studies, to enhance the robustness of findings, it would be important to control for or accurately monitor such variables. Measuring hormonal concentrations in both saliva and serum may also be advantageous. Measurement methods and standardization must also be considered due to increasing concerns around the accuracy and variability associated with testosterone measurements (Vesper & Botelho, 2010).","As previously noted, approximately 20% of volunteers were either shift or mine workers. Given the limited
sample size, subgroup analyses could not be adequately
undertaken to examine the effect of shift work on measured outcomes. However, there is research confirming
the adverse effects of shift work on general well-being,
morbidity, and hormonal concentrations such as cortisol
and testosterone. It will be important in future studies to
control for the recruitment of shift workers and/or to specifically examine the effects of ashwagandha in this
group of individuals. Given their variable sleep and daily
routines, an examination into the impact of variable dosing and timing may also be helpful.
Increases in steroid hormones such","While
these risks are specifically associated with testosterone

contexts were recognised with equivalent levels of accuracy, and with comparable RTs. These findings are
inconsistent with previous reports that emotionally valenced contexts enhance memory (as indexed by free

However, there is evidence that the effects of emotionality on memory increase with time [28], so it is possible
that the effects of the present emotionality manipulation would have become more evident with a longer

case, it is not possible to distinguish between the possibilities that the fMRI effects reflect processes sensitive
specifically to the retrieval of negative memories, as
opposed to the retrieval of memories eliciting relatively
high levels of emotional ‘arousal’ [19].","The present findings may, therefore,
reflect enhancement of activity in circuits subserving
episodic retrieval in general, rather than systems specialised for the processing of emotion.","The foregoing discussion is predicated on the assumption that the effects we observed reflect the consequences of the explicit retrieval of the test words’ study
contexts. It is possible, however, that some of these

The proportion of enrolled newborn babies who received the postnatal home visits on days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 15 varied between 86·6% (25 769 of 29 760) and 91·5% (27 235 of 29 760) (day 1 visit being the lowest). About 7% (1978 of 29 760) of deliveries were in facilities and about 9% (2673 of 29 760) of babies were delivered by a skilled birth attendant. High intervention coverage was achieved for enrolled newborn babies, with most babies receiving the cord-cleansing intervention within 24 h of birth (table 2). ","In the single chlorhexidine cleansing group, the VHWs cleansed the cord with 4% chlorhexidine only at the fi rst visit as soon as possible after birth. In the multiple chlorhexidine cleansing group, the VHWs cleansed the cord as soon as possible after birth and once a day for 7 days. In the dry cord care group, the VHWs promoted cord care messages during home visits that are recommended by WHO, and did not apply chlorhexidine to the cord. The first home visit by the VHW was recommended to be made within 6 h of delivery. At every visit, the VHW recorded the visit date and time, the newborn babies’ vital status (alive or dead), and intervention status for that day (provided or refused) with a pictorial form.","A second possibility is poorer delivery of the intervention in the multiple-cleansing group. However, we recorded no diff erence between the three groups in the timing of initiation of the interventions with 86-87% starting interventions within 24 h of birth. The mean number of intervention days was exactly 6•5 in all three groups in this trial. The proportion of individuals who received all 7 days of intervention was much the same between the single and multiple chlorhexidine groups. These proportions did not statistically diff er in terms of the risk of any umbilical redness or pus; however, the incidence of severe cord infection was substantially lower in the multiple-cleansing group compared with the control group.",,,,,,,,,Aug 1 2022 placebo/validation validation/test,Discussed,explicit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,test,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was divided into two parts scheduled in spring (N = 83) and fall (N = 70).","After the common training session, the participants assigned to the park walking group took a guided walk on a predetermined route in the nearest park at a slow, low-intensity pace. They were asked to pay attention to their surroundings and to avoid discussion during this 15-minute walk. The trainers walked the route together with the group during the training and participants were given maps showing the route. In the intervention weeks they could walk either alone or in a group, but were encouraged not to talk to each other. Before and after the park walk participants reported their level of tension on paper.","We used two procedures in the relaxation training: 1) a release-only version of progressive muscle relaxation (Öst, 1987) and 2) a deep breathing and acceptance exercise developed by Tuomisto (2007). These methods were targeted at the most important elements in relaxation: muscle relaxation, deep and slow breathing, and acceptance of the here-and-now (Grossman et al., 2004; Hayes-Skelton, Usmani, Lee, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2012; McCallie et al., 2006). The release-only version of progressive relaxation targets primarily muscle relaxation and the deep breathing exploits the potential of the vagal (i.e., parasympathetic) influence on the autonomic nervous  14 system. This method was taught for one hour. The participants were advised that each relaxation session during the intervention period should last 15 minutes and they were given written relaxation instructions, too. Before and after each relaxation exercise, participants reported their level of tension on paper.","During the intervention weeks participants were instructed to engage for 15 minutes during their lunch break on working days (altogether 10 days) in one of the activities they were randomly assigned to, namely park walking, relaxation exercises, or usual break activities (control group).

Two randomized controlled trials were conducted in Nepal. Study 1 examined stigma reduction for depression. Study 2 examined depression and psychosis. Participants were Nepali medical students (Study 1: n = 94, Study 2: n = 213) randomized to three conditions: a didactic video based on the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), a service user video about living with mental illness, or a control condition with no videos. In Study 1, videos only addressed depression. In Study 2, videos addressed depression and psychosis. In Study 1, both didactic and service user videos reduced stigma compared to the control. In Study 2 (depression and psychosis), there were no differences among the three arms.","Study 1 was a pilot RCT with a mixed-methods approach conducted in 2017 with medical students at Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine (TU-IOM) in Kathmandu, Nepal. We employed a three-armed, parallel group RCT, and randomized participants to one of three conditions: a didactic video based on the mhGAP-IG module for depression; a service user testimonial video from a person who experienced depression; or a control featuring no video. For the mixed-methods component, we also included exploratory qualitative interviews with participants. At the time of this pilot, only the depression service user video had been completed, so the study was limited to depression.","Study 2 was a full RCT that evaluated the videos in a three-armed, parallel group RCT, in which medical students had an equal chance to be randomized to a service user testimonial video condition featuring lived experiences of depression and psychosis, didactic videos based on mhGAP-IG modules for depression and psychosis, or a control condition with no video.","Study 1 (depression only): The contents for all videos are presented in Table 1. All videos were 8 min in duration to have time matching between didactic and service user videos. The didactic video was adapted using existing mhGAP-IG materials from an ongoing study in Nepal: the Programme for Improving Mental Healthcare (PRIME) [37]. PRIME is a program used to evaluate the implementation of mental health in primary care in five countries, including Nepal [38]. Materials were already adapted and translated for Nepali healthcare settings in PRIME. We reduced the content delivered in the PRIME training package about depression to an 8 min video and collaborated with a local mhGAP-IG trainer who is a Nepali psychiatrist to narrate the video in Nepali. The content follows the mhGAP-IG depression module.","A service user video was produced in collaboration with the Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers (RESHAPE) initiative in Nepal. RESHAPE is a program in which service users treated through PRIME are trained in PhotoVoice participatory techniques to develop recovery narratives, which they use to co-facilitate mental health training for health workers [33–36]. The service user in this video was selected based on her previous success of co-facilitating mental health training in RESHAPE. The script for the video was based on the narrative prepared by the service user for her PhotoVoice testimonial. During video editing, the research team selected specific content from the testimonial that matched the content of the didactic video. Additional perspectives from a health worker who diagnosed the service user and a counselor who treated her were interwoven with the testimonial to produce the final 8 min video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"Study 2 (depression and psychosis): The didactic and service user testimonial videos developed for depression in Study 1 were also used in Study 2. In addition, didactic and service user videos were developed for psychosis. The psychosis didactic video, like the one about depression, was adapted from the mhGAP-IG psychosis module used in PRIME in Nepal. The same Nepali psychiatrist who narrated the depression video also narrated the psychosis one for consistency. The service user testimonial video about psychosis was delivered by a service user who received treatment through PRIME. Due to stigma and family shame, finding a service user who was willing to speak about psychosis on video was more challenging than finding someone for depression. A person was eventually identified, and she, alongside her family members and a counselor, produced the narrative video with the research team. Because both the 8 min psychosis and 8 min depression content were included, the total duration of videos in both the didactic and service user arms was 16 min in Study 2. The service users for both the depression and psychosis videos were women 20–30 years of age.","After review of 2nd and 3rd year MBBS student rosters, 18 students were excluded prior to randomization because of being international students not speaking Nepali or having already completed their psychiatry rotation. Among the remaining students, 100 were selected for randomization to one of the three arms. No potential participants refused to participate in this study. An additional six students were excluded at the time of analysis because information on their demographic forms revealed that they were international students whose native language was not Nepali or they had completed their clinical psychiatry rotation; this information had not been up to date in the class rosters at the time of randomization (Figure 1). One participant in the service user arm was excluded because of both being an international non-Nepali student and having completed a psychiatry rotation. Demographic characteristics of these participants are in Table 2. Of note, only three participants indicated that they were primarily interested psychiatry as a specialty (see Figure 2). Participants were randomized into one the three conditions: the control group with no video (n = 31, 33%), the didactic video group (n = 31, 33%), and the service user recovery testimonial video group (n = 32; 34%).","For the second study, 248 students were enrolled in first- and second-year MBBS program across the two institutions participating. From roster, 28 students were excluded because of being international or having completed a psychiatry clinical rotation. The remaining 220 students were randomized; however, seven students declined to participate or were unavailable during data collection periods. Therefore, 213 participants were randomly allocated to the following arms: didactic video condition (n = 73), the service user video condition (n = 72), and the no video control condition (n = 75) (Figure 3). At the analysis phase, there were additional exclusions because of missing data or identification of exclusion criteria that was not recorded in the school registers. Participant characteristics for each condition are shown in Table 4.","The intervention was a single session that lasted approximately one hour for participants to provide informed consent, complete a demographic form, watch videos relevant to their study arm, complete the assessments, and be debriefed. Participants in either of the video groups stayed for the full hour, but participants in the control condition who did not watch the video finished in about 50 min. In Study 2, which included two 8 min videos with diagnostic accuracy for both conditions, the protocol required an additional 15 min. Survey data were collected using SurveyCTO (Ver 2.30, Dobility, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), an android application, on tablets (www.surveycto.com/accessed on: 19 June 2017). In Study 1, after completion of the video session, participants were invited to participate in the optional qualitative interview to be held within one week.","Figure 1, Figure 3",,2,6,,,,

Two studies were conducted to select best phosphorus and sulphur sources by using farmyard manure, poultry manure (PM), vermicompost and sewage sludge. There were six treatments in study one and two, including inorganic source of single super phosphate (SSP) and no phosphorus (control) in trial one and no sulphur (control) in trial two. They were replicated four times in a completely randomized design. Among them the selected best source poultry manure was combined with chemical fertilizer (CF) single super phosphate to supply phosphorus and sulphur by having six treatments (Control, 100%PM, 75%PM + 25%CF, 50%PM + 50%CF, 25%PM + 75% CF, 100% CF) and were replicated three times in a completely randomized design. The oil and protein content of kernels were increased as a result of phosphorus and sulphur. Poultry manure as a sole source of phosphorus and sulphur exhibited the highest oil and protein content. 25% poultry manure with 75% chemical fertilizer as a combination exhibited the highest oil content (45.20%) and 75% poultry manure with 25% chemical fertilizer as a combination resulted in the highest protein content (12.50%) of kernels.","There were three sets of studies, one on phosphorus sources, one on sulphur sources and the third on integration of phosphorus and sulphur through organic and inorganic sources.","In sole phosphorus and sulphur sources there were four organic sources (farmyard manure, poultry manure, vermicompost and sewage sludge) evaluated in comparison with the standard inorganic source of single superphosphate, all applied on equal P basis at 34 kg P2O5 ha-1 (in the phosphorus study) and on equal S basis at 75 kg S ha-1 (in the sulphur study).

                    stage: Unclear","Abstract—Context. Mindfulness is a meditation technique whose main goal is keeping the mind calm and educating attention by focusing only on one thing at a time, usually breathing. The reported benefits of its continued practice can be of interest for Software Engineering students and practitioners, especially in tasks like conceptual modeling, in which concentration and clearness of mind are crucial. Goal. In order to evaluate whether Software Engineering students enhance their conceptual modeling performance after several weeks of mindfulness practice, a series of three controlled experiments were carried out at the University of Seville during three consecutive academic years (2013–2016) involving 130 students. Method. In all the experiments, the subjects were divided into two groups. While the experimental group practiced mindfulness, the control group was trained in public speaking as a placebo treatment. All the subjects developed two conceptual models based on a transcript of an interview, one before and another one after the treatment. The results were compared in terms of conceptual modeling quality (measured as effectiveness, i.e. the percentage of model elements correctly identified) and productivity (measured as efficiency, i.e. the number of model elements correctly identified per unit of time). Results. The statistically significant results of the series of experiments revealed that the subjects who practiced mindfulness developed slightly better conceptual models (their quality was 8.16% higher) and they did it faster (they were 46.67% more productive) than the control group, even if they did not have a previous interest in meditation. Conclusions. The practice of mindfulness improves the performance of Software Engineering students in conceptual modeling, especially their productivity. Nevertheless, more experimentation is needed in order to confirm the outcomes in other Software Engineering tasks and populations.","In order to answer these research questions, an itera- tive process which consisted of a baseline experiment and two internal replications was carried out during the first semesters of the 2013–2014 [17], 2014–2015 [18] and 2015– 2016 academic years. ","For the sake of readability, the baseline experiment and the two internal replications are referred to as MIND#1, MIND#2 and MIND#3 respectively in the rest of the article.","In the mindfulness workshops, the sessions were face– to–face, four days a week. All the sessions followed the same dynamics: the students and the researcher responsible for conducting the session met in a classroom; they all sat down, lights were turned off and curtains were drawn letting only some dim light in the room; when they all were in silence, an alarm was programmed; during the first five minutes, the subjects were guided in their body scan; then, during the remaining time, they were invited to focus solely on their breathing. Sometimes, the researcher asked “where is your mind now?” in order to re–focus them on breathing. In the event some students were late, they were instructed to enter the room making as less noise as possible and sit on one of the chairs that were intentionally left empty near the door.","In the public speaking workshops, the subjects were given some basic guidelines on how to prepare a talk, some notions on non–verbal communication and some seminal talks were commented. Later, they were invited to look for related videos on the Internet and to prepare a script for a public presentation on a topic of their interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"The result of applying changes CH1 to CH3 in MIND#2 resulted in its differential settings consisting of a random assignment of subjects to groups, a postponed public speak- ing workshop, i.e. a null treatment for the control group, and a mindfulness workshop extended to 6 weeks with 12– minute sessions. All the other experiment settings were the same as in MIND#1.","In spite of the outcomes of MIND#2 regarding design ques- tions DQ1 (students’ motivation), DQ2 (placebo control con- dition) and DQ3 (duration of treatment), we decided to keep changes CH1 to CH3 in the experiment protocol in order to confirm the obtained results in the second replication.","To answer this question, we decided to extend the mindfulness workshop from 4 to 6 weeks and sessions from 10 to 12 minutes in future replications (see CH3 in Table 6). With respect to the number of weeks, it was limited not only by the required lessons on conceptual modeling so the students could perform the exercises, but also by the Christmas break, which would interrupt the mindfulness sessions. Therefore, the maximum number of weeks was limited to six weeks, from week 6 to week 11 (see Figure 3). Regarding the duration of mind- fulness sessions, we were limited by the 20–minute recess between lessons. Considering that students had to come to the meditation room and go back to their classrooms, mindfulness sessions had to be shorter than 15 minutes.",,None,,3,6,,,,

The approach combines the transfer of a productive asset with consumption support, training and coaching plus savings encouragement and health education and/or services. Results from the implementation of the same basic program, adapted to a wide variety of geographic and institutional contexts and with multiple implementing partners, show statistically significant, cost- effective impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by increases in self-employment income) and psychosocial status of the targeted households. The impact on the poor households lasted at least a year after all implementation ended. It is possible to make sustainable improvements in the economic status of the poor with a relatively short-term intervention.","Between 2007 and 2014, we conducted a multi-site RCT of the Graduation program. The sites were chosen as part of an effort led by Ford Foundation and Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), referred to here as the Graduation Program Consortium. The programs were implemented by six different organizations in six countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru), but overall planning on the programs and evaluation were coordinated from the onset.1 Treatment was randomly assigned amongst eligible households. Data were collected at baseline and just after program end, two years after the programs began (“endline 1”), and again approximately one year after the end of the programs, i.e., about three years after treatment began (“endline 2”). We report pooled results from all the sites (21,063adults in 10,495 households) as well as site by site results.","In all sites but one, the experimental design was strictly adhered to: no control received the program, and all treatment households received the program. The India site was the only site in which some individuals refused participation: 52% of those selected in the randomization participated in the program. According to Bandhan, the implementing organization, 35% of households declined the offer, for two unrelated reasons: first, in some villages, a section of villagers held the (erroneous) belief that Bandhan was a Christian organization trying to convert beneficiaries, and acceptance of the livestock constituted agreeing in some way to participating in Christian rituals. Second, some wives were worried that their husband would mishandle the asset and they would lose face in front of their village. A further 13% were deemed ineligible by Bandhan because they were participating in microcredit or self-help group activities. The analysis below is an “intention to treat”: we compare households assigned to control to those assigned to treatment, irrespective of whether they received treatment or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,6,12,,,,

Two participants had HIV at enrolment and 50 became infected during follow-up: 17 in the tenofovir group (an incidence of 0·35 per 100 person-years) and 33 in the placebo group (0·68 per 100 person-years), indicating a 48·9% reduction in HIV incidence (95% CI 9·6–72·2; p=0·01). The occurrence of serious adverse events was much the same between the two groups (p=0·35). Nausea was more common in participants in the tenofovir group than in the placebo group (p=0·002). ","We randomly assigned participants in a one-to-one ratio to receive daily oral tenofovir 300 mg or placebo in blocks of four using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. The statistician who generated the sequence was not otherwise involved in the conduct of the trial, but was involved in the fi nal analysis. When a participant completed the consent process, study staff assigned them the next sequential randomisation number. Tenofovir and placebo tablets were similar in shape, colour, and taste. Participants and study staff were masked to drug assignment. Data were locked on Jan 18, 2013, at which point PAM and MM were unmasked (other investigators were unmasked individually as needed to help with the analysis).

The PRSIST Program is a collection of professional learning, adult practices, play-based child activities, and home- based resources to support the development of children’s self- regulation. ","The control group continued with their existing program, which included structured and free play time. Given the prevalence of self-regulatory concern amongst ECEC educators, it is likely that some of these activities targeted self-regulation.

","Two cohorts of patients were analyzed for this study. Because CMS did not initially cover HBsAg testing, Cohort 1 was composed primarily of privately insured patients. Once CMS approved HBsAg testing in September 2016, we were able to randomize Cohort 2 to the alert. The EHR alert was released to this Cohort 1 in Janu- ary 2016. After CMS approved coverage for HBsAg testing among at-risk individuals, the same EHR alert was released in January 2018 to Cohort 2, which included patients with Medicare or Medicaid insurance. Therefore, Cohort 2 is more representative of the population as a whole compared to Cohort 1. Both cohorts were followed for HBsAg completion until July 2019.","The deployment of the EHR alert was previously described9. It was deployed through the health system’s electronic record (Epic Systems, Verona, WI) under the “Health Maintenance” functionality, which pro- vides reminders for periodic health screenings and preventive care, starting January 28, 2016 to the present day. A completed HBsAg test automatically changed the alert status from “Due” to “Done.” The status could also be changed manually if a patient reported having the test done in another health care system or if a patient refused testing to “previously done” or “patient declined,” respectively. Patients and providers were blinded to the study and no new interventions to increase CHB testing were implemented during the study period.

In the Imipramine trial, individuals diagnosed with major depression were randomized to imipramine treatment or placebo-pill treatment (n = 50).  In the Mind-Maastricht trial, individuals with residual depressive symptoms were randomized to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or to a waiting-list control condition (n = 119).","The flow of participants in the two studies is presented in Figs 1 and 2. In the Imipramine trial, 49 of the 63 randomized participants completed 6 weeks of treatment (for details, see previous papers14,15) and 50 of the 63 randomized participants provided ESM data at baseline and post-inter- vention and thus were included in the present analyses. In the Mind-Maastricht trial, 3 of the 130 randomized participants discontinued study participation (for details, see previous paper16) and 119 of the 130 randomized participants provided ESM data at baseline and post-intervention and were included in the analyses. Participants in the MBCT group reported practicing for 30.3 minutes (SD = 11.2) per day on average. Mindfulness practice was calculated as minutes spent on long formal exercises. In addition to the formal meditation exercises, partici- pants reported to have engaged in informal meditation exercises (such as the 3-minute breathing space) 2.2 times a day on average (SD = 1.0).
","Participants in the Imipramine trial received either twice daily imipramine (200 mg per day) or placebo (4 capsules per day) for 6 weeks. In case of intolerance, the dose was decreased to either 100 mg of imipramine per day or 2 placebo capsules per day. Both patients and the assessors of the primary outcomes were blinded to the type of treatment patients received. After 6 weeks, the treatment could be prolonged to 18 weeks.","Patients in the Mind-Maastricht trial were randomized to either an 8-week MBCT group program or to an 8-week waiting-list control condition. After the post-intervention assessment, participants in the control condi- tion had the opportunity to take part in an MBCT program. MBCT consisted of eight weekly group sessions of 2.5 hr and homework assignments of 30 to 60 minutes a day. The MBCT sessions followed the MBCT guidelines of Segal and colleagues24. The sessions covered meditation exercises (e.g., body-scan, sitting meditation), yoga exercises, and discussion of the exercises and homework assignments.","All participants provided written informed consent for study participation.

The change in reactive hyperemia index determined by EndoPAT from week 0 to 12 in the Bifal+ Arg YG group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group, indicating that Bifal+ Arg YG intake improved vascular endothelial function. In addition, the concentrations of fecal putrescine and serum spermidine in the Bifal+ Arg YG group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group.

","This study examined the short-term effects of warm-up, static stretching and dynamic stretching on hamstring flexibility in individuals with previous hamstring injury and uninjured controls.","For the static stretch (S), the participant placed their leg on an elevated surface with their knee extended and their ankle plantarflexed. Participants were then instructed to lean forward from the hip, with their spine in neutral until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh [36]. This position was held for 30 seconds, and then repeated 3 times (Figure 3). For the dynamic stretch (D), each participant was instructed to actively swing the leg to be stretched forward into hip flexion until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh whilst keeping their knee extended and their ankle plantarflexed [35]. The leg was then allowed to swing back into slight hip extension. This was repeated for 30 seconds, such that the dynamic stretch consisted of repeated hip flexion/extension swinging movements (Figure 4). Both stretches were carried out for 30 seconds and repeated three times for each leg [28], to try to ensure that each individual carried out the same amount of stretching on both days. ","A randomised crossover study design, over 2 separate days. Hamstring flexibility was assessed using passive knee extension range of motion (PKE ROM). 18 previously injured individuals and 18 uninjured controls participated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,

Participants were then instructed to lean forward from the hip, with their spine in neutral until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh [36]. This position was held for 30 seconds, and then repeated 3 times (Figure 3). For the dynamic stretch (D), each participant was instructed to actively swing the leg to be stretched forward into hip flexion until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh whilst keeping their knee extended and their ankle plantarflexed [35]. The leg was then allowed to swing back into slight hip extension. This was repeated for 30 seconds, such that the dynamic stretch consisted of repeated hip flexion/extension swinging movements (Figure 4). Both stretches were carried out for 30 seconds and repeated three times for each leg [28], to try to ensure that each individual carried out the same amount of stretching on both days.

The change in reactive hyperemia index determined by EndoPAT from week 0 to 12 in the Bifal+ Arg YG group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group, indicating that Bifal+ Arg YG intake improved vascular endothelial function. In addition, the concentrations of fecal putrescine and serum spermidine in the Bifal+ Arg YG group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group. These findings suggest that consuming Bifal+ Arg YG prevents or reduces atherosclerosis risk by upregulating blood spermidine levels, which subsequently induces autophagy.","Healthy individuals with a body mass index near the maximum value of the “healthy” range (25 kg/m3 ; n= 44, average age 45 years) consumed normal yogurt containing B. animalis ssp. lactis and Arg (Bifal+ Arg YG) or placebo (normal yogurt alone) for 12 weeks in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative study",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,

","This study evaluated the impact of didactic videos and service user testimonial videos on mental illness stigma among medical students. Two randomized controlled trials were conducted in Nepal. Study 1 examined stigma reduction for depression. Study 2 examined depression and psychosis. Participants were Nepali medical students (Study 1: n = 94, Study 2: n = 213) randomized to three conditions: a didactic video based on the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), a service user video about living with mental illness, or a control condition with no videos. In Study 1, videos only addressed depression. In Study 2, videos addressed depression and psychosis. In Study 1, both didactic and service user videos reduced stigma compared to the control. In Study 2 (depression and psychosis), there were no differences among the three arms.","Study 1 was a pilot RCT with a mixed-methods approach conducted in 2017 with medical students at Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine (TU-IOM) in Kathmandu, Nepal. We employed a three-armed, parallel group RCT, and randomized participants to one of three conditions: a didactic video based on the mhGAP-IG module for depression; a service user testimonial video from a person who experienced depression; or a control featuring no video. For the mixed-methods component, we also included exploratory qualitative interviews with participants. At the time of this pilot, only the depression service user video had been completed, so the study was limited to depression.","Study 2 was a full RCT that evaluated the videos in a three-armed, parallel group RCT, in which medical students had an equal chance to be randomized to a service user testimonial video condition featuring lived experiences of depression and psychosis, didactic videos based on mhGAP-IG modules for depression and psychosis, or a control condition with no video.","Study 1 (depression only): The contents for all videos are presented in Table 1. All videos were 8 min in duration to have time matching between didactic and service user videos. The didactic video was adapted using existing mhGAP-IG materials from an ongoing study in Nepal: the Programme for Improving Mental Healthcare (PRIME) [37]. PRIME is a program used to evaluate the implementation of mental health in primary care in five countries, including Nepal [38]. Materials were already adapted and translated for Nepali healthcare settings in PRIME. We reduced the content delivered in the PRIME training package about depression to an 8 min video and collaborated with a local mhGAP-IG trainer who is a Nepali psychiatrist to narrate the video in Nepali. The content follows the mhGAP-IG depression module.","A service user video was produced in collaboration with the Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers (RESHAPE) initiative in Nepal. RESHAPE is a program in which service users treated through PRIME are trained in PhotoVoice participatory techniques to develop recovery narratives, which they use to co-facilitate mental health training for health workers [33–36]. The service user in this video was selected based on her previous success of co-facilitating mental health training in RESHAPE. The script for the video was based on the narrative prepared by the service user for her PhotoVoice testimonial. During video editing, the research team selected specific content from the testimonial that matched the content of the didactic video. Additional perspectives from a health worker who diagnosed the service user and a counselor who treated her were interwoven with the testimonial to produce the final 8 min video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"Study 2 (depression and psychosis): The didactic and service user testimonial videos developed for depression in Study 1 were also used in Study 2. In addition, didactic and service user videos were developed for psychosis. The psychosis didactic video, like the one about depression, was adapted from the mhGAP-IG psychosis module used in PRIME in Nepal. The same Nepali psychiatrist who narrated the depression video also narrated the psychosis one for consistency. The service user testimonial video about psychosis was delivered by a service user who received treatment through PRIME. Due to stigma and family shame, finding a service user who was willing to speak about psychosis on video was more challenging than finding someone for depression. A person was eventually identified, and she, alongside her family members and a counselor, produced the narrative video with the research team. Because both the 8 min psychosis and 8 min depression content were included, the total duration of videos in both the didactic and service user arms was 16 min in Study 2. The service users for both the depression and psychosis videos were women 20–30 years of age.","After review of 2nd and 3rd year MBBS student rosters, 18 students were excluded prior to randomization because of being international students not speaking Nepali or having already completed their psychiatry rotation. Among the remaining students, 100 were selected for randomization to one of the three arms. No potential participants refused to participate in this study. An additional six students were excluded at the time of analysis because information on their demographic forms revealed that they were international students whose native language was not Nepali or they had completed their clinical psychiatry rotation; this information had not been up to date in the class rosters at the time of randomization (Figure 1). One participant in the service user arm was excluded because of both being an international non-Nepali student and having completed a psychiatry rotation. Demographic characteristics of these participants are in Table 2. Of note, only three participants indicated that they were primarily interested psychiatry as a specialty (see Figure 2). Participants were randomized into one the three conditions: the control group with no video (n = 31, 33%), the didactic video group (n = 31, 33%), and the service user recovery testimonial video group (n = 32; 34%).","For the second study, 248 students were enrolled in first- and second-year MBBS program across the two institutions participating. From roster, 28 students were excluded because of being international or having completed a psychiatry clinical rotation. The remaining 220 students were randomized; however, seven students declined to participate or were unavailable during data collection periods. Therefore, 213 participants were randomly allocated to the following arms: didactic video condition (n = 73), the service user video condition (n = 72), and the no video control condition (n = 75) (Figure 3). At the analysis phase, there were additional exclusions because of missing data or identification of exclusion criteria that was not recorded in the school registers. Participant characteristics for each condition are shown in Table 4.","The intervention was a single session that lasted approximately one hour for participants to provide informed consent, complete a demographic form, watch videos relevant to their study arm, complete the assessments, and be debriefed. Participants in either of the video groups stayed for the full hour, but participants in the control condition who did not watch the video finished in about 50 min. In Study 2, which included two 8 min videos with diagnostic accuracy for both conditions, the protocol required an additional 15 min. Survey data were collected using SurveyCTO (Ver 2.30, Dobility, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), an android application, on tablets (www.surveycto.com/accessed on: 19 June 2017). In Study 1, after completion of the video session, participants were invited to participate in the optional qualitative interview to be held within one week.","Figure 1, Figure 3",,2,6,,,,

","A pot experiment was conducted to study the effect of phosphorus and sulphur nutrients as sole and in combination from organic and integration of organic and inorganic sources on groundnut quality. Two studies were conducted to select best phosphorus and sulphur sources by using farmyard manure, poultry manure (PM), vermicompost and sewage sludge. There were six treatments in study one and two, including inorganic source of single super phosphate (SSP) and no phosphorus (control) in trial one and no sulphur (control) in trial two. They were replicated four times in a completely randomized design. Among them the selected best source poultry manure was combined with chemical fertilizer (CF) single super phosphate to supply phosphorus and sulphur by having six treatments (Control, 100%PM, 75%PM + 25%CF, 50%PM + 50%CF, 25%PM + 75% CF, 100% CF) and were replicated three times in a completely randomized design. The oil and protein content of kernels were increased as a result of phosphorus and sulphur. Poultry manure as a sole source of phosphorus and sulphur exhibited the highest oil and protein content. 25% poultry manure with 75% chemical fertilizer as a combination exhibited the highest oil content (45.20%) and 75% poultry manure with 25% chemical fertilizer as a combination resulted in the highest protein content (12.50%) of kernels.","There were three sets of studies, one on phosphorus sources, one on sulphur sources and the third on integration of phosphorus and sulphur through organic and inorganic sources.","In sole phosphorus and sulphur sources there were four organic sources (farmyard manure, poultry manure, vermicompost and sewage sludge) evaluated in comparison with the standard inorganic source of single superphosphate, all applied on equal P basis at 34 kg P2O5 ha-1 (in the phosphorus study) and on equal S basis at 75 kg S ha-1 (in the sulphur study). The six treatments, including a no-P control in phosphorus study and no-S control in sulphur study were replicated four times in a completely randomized design.","In the phosphorus x sulphur integration study, there were six treatments (100% RDF to groundnut crop through poultry manure, 75% RDF through poultry manure and 25% RDF through chemical fertilizers, 50% RDF through poultry manure and 50% RDF through chemical fertilizers, 25% RDF through poultry manure and 75% RDF through chemical fertilizers and 100% RDF through chemical fertilizers), all applied on equal P basis at 34 kg P2O5 ha-1 and on equal S basis at 75 kg S ha-1.

","Two hundred Rausa primigravidae at Zaria were divided into five groups in a randomized double-blind trial of antenatal oral antimalarial prophylaxis, and haematinic supplements. Group I received no active treatment. Groups 2 to 5 were given chloroquine 600 mg base once, followed by proguanil 100 mg per day. In addition, group 3 received iron 60 mg daily, group 4 folic acid I mg daily, and group 5 iron plus folic acid. ","Two hundred subsequent successive subjects were randomly allocated to one of five treatment groups using a random numbers table (Diem and Lenter, 1970). Neither the researchers nor the patients were aware of the treatment allocated until after the completion of the study. Five further patients were removed from the trial because of anaemia (PCV < 0·30) developing in the first week, 12 patients defaulted after only the first or second visit to the antenatal clinic, and one was found to be mentally subnormal and unable to follow instructions. These 18 patients were replaced in the trial by others; this was arranged by a moderator (Dr. B. M. Greenwood), who was not otherwise involved in the research, but had access to the treatment allocation code for this purpose. The five treatment groups, of 40 subjects each, received oral chloroquine sulphate and proguanil tablets (ICI) and spansules containing ferrous sulphate and folic acid (Smith, Kline and French), following the schedules shown in Table 2: the manufacturers supplied active tablets or spansules and the placebos*, which could not be distinguished by sight. The patients were instructed to bring any unconsumed medication to the clinic at every visit, so allowing for some check on their compliance to instructions.","The first ten successive patients were included in a pilot study: they were treated in exactly the same manner as the patients in the study, except that all received the treatment ofgroup 5 (Table 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,1,5,,,,

","We present results from six randomized control trials of an integrated approach to improve livelihoods amongst the very poor. The approach combines the transfer of a productive asset with consumption support, training and coaching plus savings encouragement and health education and/or services. Results from the implementation of the same basic program, adapted to a wide variety of geographic and institutional contexts and with multiple implementing partners, show statistically significant, cost- effective impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by increases in self-employment income) and psychosocial status of the targeted households. The impact on the poor households lasted at least a year after all implementation ended. It is possible to make sustainable improvements in the economic status of the poor with a relatively short-term intervention.","Between 2007 and 2014, we conducted a multi-site RCT of the Graduation program. The sites were chosen as part of an effort led by Ford Foundation and Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), referred to here as the Graduation Program Consortium. The programs were implemented by six different organizations in six countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru), but overall planning on the programs and evaluation were coordinated from the onset.1 Treatment was randomly assigned amongst eligible households. Data were collected at baseline and just after program end, two years after the programs began (“endline 1”), and again approximately one year after the end of the programs, i.e., about three years after treatment began (“endline 2”). We report pooled results from all the sites (21,063adults in 10,495 households) as well as site by site results.","In all sites but one, the experimental design was strictly adhered to: no control received the program, and all treatment households received the program. The India site was the only site in which some individuals refused participation: 52% of those selected in the randomization participated in the program. According to Bandhan, the implementing organization, 35% of households declined the offer, for two unrelated reasons: first, in some villages, a section of villagers held the (erroneous) belief that Bandhan was a Christian organization trying to convert beneficiaries, and acceptance of the livestock constituted agreeing in some way to participating in Christian rituals. Second, some wives were worried that their husband would mishandle the asset and they would lose face in front of their village. A further 13% were deemed ineligible by Bandhan because they were participating in microcredit or self-help group activities. The analysis below is an “intention to treat”: we compare households assigned to control to those assigned to treatment, irrespective of whether they received treatment or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,6,12,,,,

","This study examined whether treatment with imipramine or treatment with Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) reduces the connectivity within dynamic networks of mental states in individuals with depressive symptoms. In the Imipramine trial, individuals diagnosed with major depression were randomized to imipramine treatment or placebo-pill treatment (n = 50).  In the Mind-Maastricht trial, individuals with residual depressive symptoms were randomized to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or to a waiting-list control condition (n = 119).","The flow of participants in the two studies is presented in Figs 1 and 2. In the Imipramine trial, 49 of the 63 randomized participants completed 6 weeks of treatment (for details, see previous papers14,15) and 50 of the 63 randomized participants provided ESM data at baseline and post-inter- vention and thus were included in the present analyses. In the Mind-Maastricht trial, 3 of the 130 randomized participants discontinued study participation (for details, see previous paper16) and 119 of the 130 randomized participants provided ESM data at baseline and post-intervention and were included in the analyses. Participants in the MBCT group reported practicing for 30.3 minutes (SD = 11.2) per day on average. Mindfulness practice was calculated as minutes spent on long formal exercises. In addition to the formal meditation exercises, partici- pants reported to have engaged in informal meditation exercises (such as the 3-minute breathing space) 2.2 times a day on average (SD = 1.0).
","Participants in the Imipramine trial received either twice daily imipramine (200 mg per day) or placebo (4 capsules per day) for 6 weeks. In case of intolerance, the dose was decreased to either 100 mg of imipramine per day or 2 placebo capsules per day. Both patients and the assessors of the primary outcomes were blinded to the type of treatment patients received. After 6 weeks, the treatment could be prolonged to 18 weeks.","Patients in the Mind-Maastricht trial were randomized to either an 8-week MBCT group program or to an 8-week waiting-list control condition. After the post-intervention assessment, participants in the control condi- tion had the opportunity to take part in an MBCT program. MBCT consisted of eight weekly group sessions of 2.5 hr and homework assignments of 30 to 60 minutes a day. The MBCT sessions followed the MBCT guidelines of Segal and colleagues24. The sessions covered meditation exercises (e.g., body-scan, sitting meditation), yoga exercises, and discussion of the exercises and homework assignments.","All participants provided written informed consent for study participation. The inclusion cri- teria of the Imipramine trial and the Mind-Maastricht trial differed from each other as both trials were conducted independently of each other. The inclusion criteria of the Imipramine trial were: age between 18 and 65 years, a DSM-IV diagnosis of current major depressive disorder, a score of ≥18 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)23, a score of ≥4 on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), no current use of psycho- tropic medications, and no diagnosis of a major medical disorder. In the original trial, 63 patients with a diag- nosis of major depressive disorder were recruited from primary care practices. In the current study, participants who had completed ESM assessments both at baseline and after treatment with imipramine (n = 23) or placebo (n = 27) were included in the analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,Analyses of the current study included patients with ESM assessments at baseline and after MBCT (n = 57) or after the wait- ing period (n = 62).,,,,"Figure 1, Figure 2",Y,2,4,,,,

","Abstract—Context. Mindfulness is a meditation technique whose main goal is keeping the mind calm and educating attention by focusing only on one thing at a time, usually breathing. The reported benefits of its continued practice can be of interest for Software Engineering students and practitioners, especially in tasks like conceptual modeling, in which concentration and clearness of mind are crucial. Goal. In order to evaluate whether Software Engineering students enhance their conceptual modeling performance after several weeks of mindfulness practice, a series of three controlled experiments were carried out at the University of Seville during three consecutive academic years (2013–2016) involving 130 students. Method. In all the experiments, the subjects were divided into two groups. While the experimental group practiced mindfulness, the control group was trained in public speaking as a placebo treatment. All the subjects developed two conceptual models based on a transcript of an interview, one before and another one after the treatment. The results were compared in terms of conceptual modeling quality (measured as effectiveness, i.e. the percentage of model elements correctly identified) and productivity (measured as efficiency, i.e. the number of model elements correctly identified per unit of time). Results. The statistically significant results of the series of experiments revealed that the subjects who practiced mindfulness developed slightly better conceptual models (their quality was 8.16% higher) and they did it faster (they were 46.67% more productive) than the control group, even if they did not have a previous interest in meditation. Conclusions. The practice of mindfulness improves the performance of Software Engineering students in conceptual modeling, especially their productivity. Nevertheless, more experimentation is needed in order to confirm the outcomes in other Software Engineering tasks and populations.","In order to answer these research questions, an itera- tive process which consisted of a baseline experiment and two internal replications was carried out during the first semesters of the 2013–2014 [17], 2014–2015 [18] and 2015– 2016 academic years. ","For the sake of readability, the baseline experiment and the two internal replications are referred to as MIND#1, MIND#2 and MIND#3 respectively in the rest of the article.","In the mindfulness workshops, the sessions were face– to–face, four days a week. All the sessions followed the same dynamics: the students and the researcher responsible for conducting the session met in a classroom; they all sat down, lights were turned off and curtains were drawn letting only some dim light in the room; when they all were in silence, an alarm was programmed; during the first five minutes, the subjects were guided in their body scan; then, during the remaining time, they were invited to focus solely on their breathing. Sometimes, the researcher asked “where is your mind now?” in order to re–focus them on breathing. In the event some students were late, they were instructed to enter the room making as less noise as possible and sit on one of the chairs that were intentionally left empty near the door.","In the public speaking workshops, the subjects were given some basic guidelines on how to prepare a talk, some notions on non–verbal communication and some seminal talks were commented. Later, they were invited to look for related videos on the Internet and to prepare a script for a public presentation on a topic of their interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"The result of applying changes CH1 to CH3 in MIND#2 resulted in its differential settings consisting of a random assignment of subjects to groups, a postponed public speak- ing workshop, i.e. a null treatment for the control group, and a mindfulness workshop extended to 6 weeks with 12– minute sessions. All the other experiment settings were the same as in MIND#1.","In spite of the outcomes of MIND#2 regarding design ques- tions DQ1 (students’ motivation), DQ2 (placebo control con- dition) and DQ3 (duration of treatment), we decided to keep changes CH1 to CH3 in the experiment protocol in order to confirm the obtained results in the second replication.","To answer this question, we decided to extend the mindfulness workshop from 4 to 6 weeks and sessions from 10 to 12 minutes in future replications (see CH3 in Table 6). With respect to the number of weeks, it was limited not only by the required lessons on conceptual modeling so the students could perform the exercises, but also by the Christmas break, which would interrupt the mindfulness sessions. Therefore, the maximum number of weeks was limited to six weeks, from week 6 to week 11 (see Figure 3).

","Using a randomized controlled design, we evaluated a testimonial-based intervention to reduce drowning risk among 280 3rd- and 4th-grade rural Chinese children. Children were randomly assigned to view either testimonials on drowning risk (intervention) or dog-bite risk (control). Safety knowledge and perceived vulnerability were measured by self-report questionnaires, and simulated behaviors in and near water were assessed with a culturally appro- priate dollhouse task.","Power analysis was performed a priori and minimum sample size calculated based on the following proce- dure. An estimated effect size of d 1⁄4 0.33 for the inter- vention effect was determined based on results from a similar video-based intervention study of playground safety in Canada (Morrongiello & Matheis, 2007b). It was determined that 76 participants in total would be required to detect the expected effect of the main out- comes between the intervention and comparison groups with a power of 0.99 (two tails, a 1⁄4 .01) using G*Power 3.1; our anticipated sample from any single elementary school in rural China was much larger.","The present study used a randomized repeated mea- sures intervention-control design (allocation ratio 1:1 with no changes in design after trial commencement) to evaluate the efficacy of a testimonial-based video intervention on reducing drowning risk among school-aged children in rural China. We hypothesized that children in the intervention group who watched the testimonials would obtain higher scores on safety knowledge, perceived vulnerability, and simulated behaviors around water than those in the comparison group. We also performed a secondary exploratory analysis evaluating potential constructs that might influence the efficacy of the intervention.",The Testimonial-based Intervention on Drowning Prevention is a 36-min video consisting of four testi- monial stories about actual near-drowning experi- ences that occurred in rural China (see Supplementary Material for sample script).,Children in the com- parison group viewed a different 36-min testimonial video consisting of four testimonials on dog-bite pre- vention. Those testimonials were created to be of the same length and structure as the drowning testimo- nials and therefore offer a comparable active control group.

","The Preschool Situational Self-Regulation Toolkit (PRSIST) Program was developed as a low-cost and embedded approach for educators to foster pre-schoolers’ self- regulation and related abilities (e.g., executive function, school readiness). This study reports on a cluster RCT study with 50 Australian pre-school services to evaluate the effectiveness of the PRSIST Program for improving children’s self-regulation, executive function and school readiness, compared to current routine practice. ","All children in their final prior-to-school year in these centers, who attended at least one of the 1–2 assessment days, were invited to participate in this study. There were no further exclusion criteria. Parental consent to participate was provided for 547 3- 5-year old children, all of whom were identified as likely to be attending school in the subsequent year. The flow of participants throughout the study is depicted in Figure 1. At baseline, 473 of these children were assessed (86.5%), with non-participation largely due to absence on the day of assessment.","The Preschool Situational Self-Regulation Toolkit (PRSIST) Program aims to engage, challenge and extend young children’s self-regulation in ways that are playful, low-cost, routine, and target each of the aspects required for successful self-regulation (i.e., goal setting, motivation, problem solving, self-regulatory capacity). The PRSIST Program is a collection of professional learning, adult practices, play-based child activities, and home- based resources to support the development of children’s self- regulation. ","The control group continued with their existing program, which included structured and free play time. Given the prevalence of self-regulatory concern amongst ECEC educators, it is likely that some of these activities targeted self-regulation. Further, it is expected that at least some of the educators would have attended professional development during the trial, and some of this might have concerned self-regulation. However, all of this can be considered current routine practice and represents an appropriately active control condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,Figure 2,,1,2,,,,

","In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled volunteers from 17 drug-treatment clinics in Bangkok, Thailand. Participants were eligible if they were aged 20–60 years, were HIV-negative, and reported injecting drugs during the previous year. We randomly assigned participants (1:1; blocks of four) to either tenofovir or placebo using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. Participants chose either daily directly observed treatment or monthly visits and could switch at monthly visits. Participants received monthly HIV testing and individualised risk-reduction and adherence counselling, blood safety assessments every 3 months, and were off ered condoms and methadone treatment. The primary effi cacy endpoint was HIV infection, analysed by modifi ed intention-to-treat analysis.

The occurrence of serious adverse events was much the same between the two groups (p=0·35). Nausea was more common in participants in the tenofovir group than in the placebo group (p=0·002). ","We randomly assigned participants in a one-to-one ratio to receive daily oral tenofovir 300 mg or placebo in blocks of four using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. The statistician who generated the sequence was not otherwise involved in the conduct of the trial, but was involved in the fi nal analysis. When a participant completed the consent process, study staff assigned them the next sequential randomisation number. Tenofovir and placebo tablets were similar in shape, colour, and taste. Participants and study staff were masked to drug assignment.

","This program, known as Legacy for ChildrenTM (Legacy), was developed as a positive parenting program to promote child development by supporting sensitive, responsive parent-child relationships; building maternal self-efficacy; and fostering peer networks of support among mothers living in poverty.","In an effort to promote the health and developmental outcomes of children born into poverty, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conceptualized and designed the Legacy for ChildrenTM (Legacy) public health prevention model. This article examines the impact of Legacy on children’s cognitive and language development (intelligence quotient [IQ], achievement, language skills, and early reading skills) using both standardized assessments and parent-reported indictors through third grade.","The Legacy prevention program has been evaluated with a set of randomized controlled trials (ClinicalTrials.gov registry #: NCT00164697) at 2 intervention sites (LA and Miami). The 2 sites developed and implemented their own curricula around the 5 Legacy goals and core model components. The resulting interventions differed as a result of each site’s community, demographic and cultural characteristics, and intervention delivery factors informed by a full-length pilot assessment. Miami offered weekly parent group sessions from the target child’s birth to age 5 years; LA held 5 prenatal sessions and 9 blocks of 10- week sessions starting prenatally and ending when the child was 3 years old. The developmentally sequenced Legacy curricula cover themes such as discipline, attachment, developmental milestones, parenting stress management, establishment of goals and dreams for their children, and early literacy.","Data were collected from 2009 to 2014 from 541 mother-child dyads who were recruited into the 2 concurrent trials of Legacy for ChildrenTM at the University of Miami (n =277) and at the University of California Los Angeles (n = 264). Demographic characteristics of the Legacy intervention and sample population have been reported elsewhere.17 Eligibility criteria for both sites included that the mother’s age was 18 years or older and that she was comfortable speaking English, that she resided within the intervention catchment area, that she had received at least some prenatal care during her pregnancy with the target child, that she had custody of the target child, and that her income was below 200% of the federal poverty line at the time of recruitment. In Miami, mothers who were eligible for Medicaid, food stamps, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families were recruited from 2 hospitals within 72 hours of delivery of the target child. In Los Angeles (LA), expectant mothers were recruited prenatally from Women, Infants and Children clinics. Participants were randomized at a 3 (intervention) to 2 (comparison) ratio in order to guard against differential attrition from the treatment group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,Figure 1,"No, because experiments are listed together.

","We conducted two randomized controlled trials with 153 Finnish knowledge workers who engaged for 15 minutes daily in prescribed lunch break activities for ten consecutive working days. Participants were randomly assigned to a: 1) park walking group (N = 51), 2) relaxation exercises group (N = 46) and 3) control group (N = 56). The study was divided into two parts scheduled in spring (N = 83) and fall (N = 70).","After the common training session, the participants assigned to the park walking group took a guided walk on a predetermined route in the nearest park at a slow, low-intensity pace. They were asked to pay attention to their surroundings and to avoid discussion during this 15-minute walk. The trainers walked the route together with the group during the training and participants were given maps showing the route. In the intervention weeks they could walk either alone or in a group, but were encouraged not to talk to each other. Before and after the park walk participants reported their level of tension on paper.","We used two procedures in the relaxation training: 1) a release-only version of progressive muscle relaxation (Öst, 1987) and 2) a deep breathing and acceptance exercise developed by Tuomisto (2007). These methods were targeted at the most important elements in relaxation: muscle relaxation, deep and slow breathing, and acceptance of the here-and-now (Grossman et al., 2004; Hayes-Skelton, Usmani, Lee, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2012; McCallie et al., 2006). The release-only version of progressive relaxation targets primarily muscle relaxation and the deep breathing exploits the potential of the vagal (i.e., parasympathetic) influence on the autonomic nervous  14 system. This method was taught for one hour. The participants were advised that each relaxation session during the intervention period should last 15 minutes and they were given written relaxation instructions, too. Before and after each relaxation exercise, participants reported their level of tension on paper.","During the intervention weeks participants were instructed to engage for 15 minutes during their lunch break on working days (altogether 10 days) in one of the activities they were randomly assigned to, namely park walking, relaxation exercises, or usual break activities (control group). ","The first RCT took place in spring (starting in week 18) and the second identical RCT in fall 2014 (starting in week 35). Thus, the second RCT in fall was a replication of the RCT in spring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,2,6,,,,

Participants were then instructed to lean forward from the hip, with their spine in neutral until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh [36].

For the dynamic stretch (D), each participant was instructed to actively swing the leg to be stretched forward into hip flexion until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh whilst keeping their knee extended and their ankle plantarflexed [35]. The leg was then allowed to swing back into slight hip extension. This was repeated for 30 seconds, such that the dynamic stretch consisted of repeated hip flexion/extension swinging movements (Figure 4).

The change in reactive hyperemia index determined by EndoPAT from week 0 to 12 in the Bifal+ Arg YG group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group, indicating that Bifal+ Arg YG intake improved vascular endothelial function. In addition, the concentrations of fecal putrescine and serum spermidine in the Bifal+ Arg YG group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group. These findings suggest that consuming Bifal+ Arg YG prevents or reduces atherosclerosis risk by upregulating blood spermidine levels, which subsequently induces autophagy.","Healthy individuals with a body mass index near the maximum value of the “healthy” range (25 kg/m3 ; n= 44, average age 45 years) consumed normal yogurt containing B. animalis ssp. lactis and Arg (Bifal+ Arg YG) or placebo (normal yogurt alone) for 12 weeks in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative study",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,

                Analysed: Gold standard not yet collected","This study evaluated the impact of didactic videos and service user testimonial videos on mental illness stigma among medical students. Two randomized controlled trials were conducted in Nepal. Study 1 examined stigma reduction for depression. Study 2 examined depression and psychosis. Participants were Nepali medical students (Study 1: n = 94, Study 2: n = 213) randomized to three conditions: a didactic video based on the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), a service user video about living with mental illness, or a control condition with no videos. In Study 1, videos only addressed depression. In Study 2, videos addressed depression and psychosis. In Study 1, both didactic and service user videos reduced stigma compared to the control. In Study 2 (depression and psychosis), there were no differences among the three arms.","Study 1 was a pilot RCT with a mixed-methods approach conducted in 2017 with medical students at Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine (TU-IOM) in Kathmandu, Nepal. We employed a three-armed, parallel group RCT, and randomized participants to one of three conditions: a didactic video based on the mhGAP-IG module for depression; a service user testimonial video from a person who experienced depression; or a control featuring no video. For the mixed-methods component, we also included exploratory qualitative interviews with participants. At the time of this pilot, only the depression service user video had been completed, so the study was limited to depression.","Study 2 was a full RCT that evaluated the videos in a three-armed, parallel group RCT, in which medical students had an equal chance to be randomized to a service user testimonial video condition featuring lived experiences of depression and psychosis, didactic videos based on mhGAP-IG modules for depression and psychosis, or a control condition with no video.","Study 1 (depression only): The contents for all videos are presented in Table 1. All videos were 8 min in duration to have time matching between didactic and service user videos. The didactic video was adapted using existing mhGAP-IG materials from an ongoing study in Nepal: the Programme for Improving Mental Healthcare (PRIME) [37]. PRIME is a program used to evaluate the implementation of mental health in primary care in five countries, including Nepal [38]. Materials were already adapted and translated for Nepali healthcare settings in PRIME. We reduced the content delivered in the PRIME training package about depression to an 8 min video and collaborated with a local mhGAP-IG trainer who is a Nepali psychiatrist to narrate the video in Nepali. The content follows the mhGAP-IG depression module.","A service user video was produced in collaboration with the Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers (RESHAPE) initiative in Nepal. RESHAPE is a program in which service users treated through PRIME are trained in PhotoVoice participatory techniques to develop recovery narratives, which they use to co-facilitate mental health training for health workers [33–36]. The service user in this video was selected based on her previous success of co-facilitating mental health training in RESHAPE. The script for the video was based on the narrative prepared by the service user for her PhotoVoice testimonial. During video editing, the research team selected specific content from the testimonial that matched the content of the didactic video. Additional perspectives from a health worker who diagnosed the service user and a counselor who treated her were interwoven with the testimonial to produce the final 8 min video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"Study 2 (depression and psychosis): The didactic and service user testimonial videos developed for depression in Study 1 were also used in Study 2. In addition, didactic and service user videos were developed for psychosis. The psychosis didactic video, like the one about depression, was adapted from the mhGAP-IG psychosis module used in PRIME in Nepal. The same Nepali psychiatrist who narrated the depression video also narrated the psychosis one for consistency. The service user testimonial video about psychosis was delivered by a service user who received treatment through PRIME. Due to stigma and family shame, finding a service user who was willing to speak about psychosis on video was more challenging than finding someone for depression. A person was eventually identified, and she, alongside her family members and a counselor, produced the narrative video with the research team. Because both the 8 min psychosis and 8 min depression content were included, the total duration of videos in both the didactic and service user arms was 16 min in Study 2. The service users for both the depression and psychosis videos were women 20–30 years of age.","After review of 2nd and 3rd year MBBS student rosters, 18 students were excluded prior to randomization because of being international students not speaking Nepali or having already completed their psychiatry rotation. Among the remaining students, 100 were selected for randomization to one of the three arms. No potential participants refused to participate in this study. An additional six students were excluded at the time of analysis because information on their demographic forms revealed that they were international students whose native language was not Nepali or they had completed their clinical psychiatry rotation; this information had not been up to date in the class rosters at the time of randomization (Figure 1). One participant in the service user arm was excluded because of both being an international non-Nepali student and having completed a psychiatry rotation. Demographic characteristics of these participants are in Table 2. Of note, only three participants indicated that they were primarily interested psychiatry as a specialty (see Figure 2). Participants were randomized into one the three conditions: the control group with no video (n = 31, 33%), the didactic video group (n = 31, 33%), and the service user recovery testimonial video group (n = 32; 34%).","For the second study, 248 students were enrolled in first- and second-year MBBS program across the two institutions participating. From roster, 28 students were excluded because of being international or having completed a psychiatry clinical rotation. The remaining 220 students were randomized; however, seven students declined to participate or were unavailable during data collection periods. Therefore, 213 participants were randomly allocated to the following arms: didactic video condition (n = 73), the service user video condition (n = 72), and the no video control condition (n = 75) (Figure 3). At the analysis phase, there were additional exclusions because of missing data or identification of exclusion criteria that was not recorded in the school registers. Participant characteristics for each condition are shown in Table 4.","The intervention was a single session that lasted approximately one hour for participants to provide informed consent, complete a demographic form, watch videos relevant to their study arm, complete the assessments, and be debriefed. Participants in either of the video groups stayed for the full hour, but participants in the control condition who did not watch the video finished in about 50 min. In Study 2, which included two 8 min videos with diagnostic accuracy for both conditions, the protocol required an additional 15 min. Survey data were collected using SurveyCTO (Ver 2.30, Dobility, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), an android application, on tablets (www.surveycto.com/accessed on: 19 June 2017). In Study 1, after completion of the video session, participants were invited to participate in the optional qualitative interview to be held within one week.","Figure 1, Figure 3",,2,6,,,checked,

","A pot experiment was conducted to study the effect of phosphorus and sulphur nutrients as sole and in combination from organic and integration of organic and inorganic sources on groundnut quality. Two studies were conducted to select best phosphorus and sulphur sources by using farmyard manure, poultry manure (PM), vermicompost and sewage sludge. There were six treatments in study one and two, including inorganic source of single super phosphate (SSP) and no phosphorus (control) in trial one and no sulphur (control) in trial two. They were replicated four times in a completely randomized design. Among them the selected best source poultry manure was combined with chemical fertilizer (CF) single super phosphate to supply phosphorus and sulphur by having six treatments (Control, 100%PM, 75%PM + 25%CF, 50%PM + 50%CF, 25%PM + 75% CF, 100% CF) and were replicated three times in a completely randomized design. The oil and protein content of kernels were increased as a result of phosphorus and sulphur. Poultry manure as a sole source of phosphorus and sulphur exhibited the highest oil and protein content. 25% poultry manure with 75% chemical fertilizer as a combination exhibited the highest oil content (45.20%) and 75% poultry manure with 25% chemical fertilizer as a combination resulted in the highest protein content (12.50%) of kernels.","There were three sets of studies, one on phosphorus sources, one on sulphur sources and the third on integration of phosphorus and sulphur through organic and inorganic sources.","In sole phosphorus and sulphur sources there were four organic sources (farmyard manure, poultry manure, vermicompost and sewage sludge) evaluated in comparison with the standard inorganic source of single superphosphate, all applied on equal P basis at 34 kg P2O5 ha-1 (in the phosphorus study) and on equal S basis at 75 kg S ha-1 (in the sulphur study). The six treatments, including a no-P control in phosphorus study and no-S control in sulphur study were replicated four times in a completely randomized design.","In the phosphorus x sulphur integration study, there were six treatments (100% RDF to groundnut crop through poultry manure, 75% RDF through poultry manure and 25% RDF through chemical fertilizers, 50% RDF through poultry manure and 50% RDF through chemical fertilizers, 25% RDF through poultry manure and 75% RDF through chemical fertilizers and 100% RDF through chemical fertilizers), all applied on equal P basis at 34 kg P2O5 ha-1 and on equal S basis at 75 kg S ha-1.

These 18 patients were replaced in the trial by others; this was arranged by a moderator (Dr. B. M. Greenwood), who was not otherwise involved in the research, but had access to the treatment allocation code for this purpose.

","We present results from six randomized control trials of an integrated approach to improve livelihoods amongst the very poor. The approach combines the transfer of a productive asset with consumption support, training and coaching plus savings encouragement and health education and/or services. Results from the implementation of the same basic program, adapted to a wide variety of geographic and institutional contexts and with multiple implementing partners, show statistically significant, cost- effective impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by increases in self-employment income) and psychosocial status of the targeted households. The impact on the poor households lasted at least a year after all implementation ended. It is possible to make sustainable improvements in the economic status of the poor with a relatively short-term intervention.","Between 2007 and 2014, we conducted a multi-site RCT of the Graduation program. The sites were chosen as part of an effort led by Ford Foundation and Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), referred to here as the Graduation Program Consortium. The programs were implemented by six different organizations in six countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru), but overall planning on the programs and evaluation were coordinated from the onset.1 Treatment was randomly assigned amongst eligible households. Data were collected at baseline and just after program end, two years after the programs began (“endline 1”), and again approximately one year after the end of the programs, i.e., about three years after treatment began (“endline 2”). We report pooled results from all the sites (21,063adults in 10,495 households) as well as site by site results.","In all sites but one, the experimental design was strictly adhered to: no control received the program, and all treatment households received the program. The India site was the only site in which some individuals refused participation: 52% of those selected in the randomization participated in the program. According to Bandhan, the implementing organization, 35% of households declined the offer, for two unrelated reasons: first, in some villages, a section of villagers held the (erroneous) belief that Bandhan was a Christian organization trying to convert beneficiaries, and acceptance of the livestock constituted agreeing in some way to participating in Christian rituals. Second, some wives were worried that their husband would mishandle the asset and they would lose face in front of their village. A further 13% were deemed ineligible by Bandhan because they were participating in microcredit or self-help group activities. The analysis below is an “intention to treat”: we compare households assigned to control to those assigned to treatment, irrespective of whether they received treatment or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,6,12,,,,

","This study examined whether treatment with imipramine or treatment with Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) reduces the connectivity within dynamic networks of mental states in individuals with depressive symptoms. In the Imipramine trial, individuals diagnosed with major depression were randomized to imipramine treatment or placebo-pill treatment (n = 50).  In the Mind-Maastricht trial, individuals with residual depressive symptoms were randomized to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or to a waiting-list control condition (n = 119).","The flow of participants in the two studies is presented in Figs 1 and 2. In the Imipramine trial, 49 of the 63 randomized participants completed 6 weeks of treatment (for details, see previous papers14,15) and 50 of the 63 randomized participants provided ESM data at baseline and post-inter- vention and thus were included in the present analyses. In the Mind-Maastricht trial, 3 of the 130 randomized participants discontinued study participation (for details, see previous paper16) and 119 of the 130 randomized participants provided ESM data at baseline and post-intervention and were included in the analyses. Participants in the MBCT group reported practicing for 30.3 minutes (SD = 11.2) per day on average. Mindfulness practice was calculated as minutes spent on long formal exercises. In addition to the formal meditation exercises, partici- pants reported to have engaged in informal meditation exercises (such as the 3-minute breathing space) 2.2 times a day on average (SD = 1.0).
","Participants in the Imipramine trial received either twice daily imipramine (200 mg per day) or placebo (4 capsules per day) for 6 weeks. In case of intolerance, the dose was decreased to either 100 mg of imipramine per day or 2 placebo capsules per day. Both patients and the assessors of the primary outcomes were blinded to the type of treatment patients received. After 6 weeks, the treatment could be prolonged to 18 weeks.","Patients in the Mind-Maastricht trial were randomized to either an 8-week MBCT group program or to an 8-week waiting-list control condition. After the post-intervention assessment, participants in the control condi- tion had the opportunity to take part in an MBCT program. MBCT consisted of eight weekly group sessions of 2.5 hr and homework assignments of 30 to 60 minutes a day. The MBCT sessions followed the MBCT guidelines of Segal and colleagues24. The sessions covered meditation exercises (e.g., body-scan, sitting meditation), yoga exercises, and discussion of the exercises and homework assignments.","All participants provided written informed consent for study participation. The inclusion cri- teria of the Imipramine trial and the Mind-Maastricht trial differed from each other as both trials were conducted independently of each other. The inclusion criteria of the Imipramine trial were: age between 18 and 65 years, a DSM-IV diagnosis of current major depressive disorder, a score of ≥18 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)23, a score of ≥4 on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), no current use of psycho- tropic medications, and no diagnosis of a major medical disorder. In the original trial, 63 patients with a diag- nosis of major depressive disorder were recruited from primary care practices. In the current study, participants who had completed ESM assessments both at baseline and after treatment with imipramine (n = 23) or placebo (n = 27) were included in the analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,Analyses of the current study included patients with ESM assessments at baseline and after MBCT (n = 57) or after the wait- ing period (n = 62).,,,,"Figure 1, Figure 2",Y,2,4,,,,

","Abstract—Context. Mindfulness is a meditation technique whose main goal is keeping the mind calm and educating attention by focusing only on one thing at a time, usually breathing. The reported benefits of its continued practice can be of interest for Software Engineering students and practitioners, especially in tasks like conceptual modeling, in which concentration and clearness of mind are crucial. Goal. In order to evaluate whether Software Engineering students enhance their conceptual modeling performance after several weeks of mindfulness practice, a series of three controlled experiments were carried out at the University of Seville during three consecutive academic years (2013–2016) involving 130 students. Method. In all the experiments, the subjects were divided into two groups. While the experimental group practiced mindfulness, the control group was trained in public speaking as a placebo treatment. All the subjects developed two conceptual models based on a transcript of an interview, one before and another one after the treatment. The results were compared in terms of conceptual modeling quality (measured as effectiveness, i.e. the percentage of model elements correctly identified) and productivity (measured as efficiency, i.e. the number of model elements correctly identified per unit of time). Results. The statistically significant results of the series of experiments revealed that the subjects who practiced mindfulness developed slightly better conceptual models (their quality was 8.16% higher) and they did it faster (they were 46.67% more productive) than the control group, even if they did not have a previous interest in meditation. Conclusions. The practice of mindfulness improves the performance of Software Engineering students in conceptual modeling, especially their productivity. Nevertheless, more experimentation is needed in order to confirm the outcomes in other Software Engineering tasks and populations.","In order to answer these research questions, an itera- tive process which consisted of a baseline experiment and two internal replications was carried out during the first semesters of the 2013–2014 [17], 2014–2015 [18] and 2015– 2016 academic years. ","For the sake of readability, the baseline experiment and the two internal replications are referred to as MIND#1, MIND#2 and MIND#3 respectively in the rest of the article.","In the mindfulness workshops, the sessions were face– to–face, four days a week. All the sessions followed the same dynamics: the students and the researcher responsible for conducting the session met in a classroom; they all sat down, lights were turned off and curtains were drawn letting only some dim light in the room; when they all were in silence, an alarm was programmed; during the first five minutes, the subjects were guided in their body scan; then, during the remaining time, they were invited to focus solely on their breathing. Sometimes, the researcher asked “where is your mind now?” in order to re–focus them on breathing. In the event some students were late, they were instructed to enter the room making as less noise as possible and sit on one of the chairs that were intentionally left empty near the door.","In the public speaking workshops, the subjects were given some basic guidelines on how to prepare a talk, some notions on non–verbal communication and some seminal talks were commented. Later, they were invited to look for related videos on the Internet and to prepare a script for a public presentation on a topic of their interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"The result of applying changes CH1 to CH3 in MIND#2 resulted in its differential settings consisting of a random assignment of subjects to groups, a postponed public speak- ing workshop, i.e. a null treatment for the control group, and a mindfulness workshop extended to 6 weeks with 12– minute sessions. All the other experiment settings were the same as in MIND#1.","In spite of the outcomes of MIND#2 regarding design ques- tions DQ1 (students’ motivation), DQ2 (placebo control con- dition) and DQ3 (duration of treatment), we decided to keep changes CH1 to CH3 in the experiment protocol in order to confirm the obtained results in the second replication.","To answer this question, we decided to extend the mindfulness workshop from 4 to 6 weeks and sessions from 10 to 12 minutes in future replications (see CH3 in Table 6). With respect to the number of weeks, it was limited not only by the required lessons on conceptual modeling so the students could perform the exercises, but also by the Christmas break, which would interrupt the mindfulness sessions. Therefore, the maximum number of weeks was limited to six weeks, from week 6 to week 11 (see Figure 3). Regarding the duration of mind- fulness sessions, we were limited by the 20–minute recess between lessons. Considering that students had to come to the meditation room and go back to their classrooms, mindfulness sessions had to be shorter than 15 minutes.",,None,,3,6,,,,

Children were randomly assigned to view either testimonials on drowning risk (intervention) or dog-bite risk (control). Safety knowledge and perceived vulnerability were measured by self-report questionnaires, and simulated behaviors in and near water were assessed with a culturally appro- priate dollhouse task.","Power analysis was performed a priori and minimum sample size calculated based on the following proce- dure. An estimated effect size of d 1⁄4 0.33 for the inter- vention effect was determined based on results from a similar video-based intervention study of playground safety in Canada (Morrongiello & Matheis, 2007b). It was determined that 76 participants in total would be required to detect the expected effect of the main out- comes between the intervention and comparison groups with a power of 0.99 (two tails, a 1⁄4 .01) using G*Power 3.1; our anticipated sample from any single elementary school in rural China was much larger.","The present study used a randomized repeated mea- sures intervention-control design (allocation ratio 1:1 with no changes in design after trial commencement) to evaluate the efficacy of a testimonial-based video intervention on reducing drowning risk among school-aged children in rural China. We hypothesized that children in the intervention group who watched the testimonials would obtain higher scores on safety knowledge, perceived vulnerability, and simulated behaviors around water than those in the comparison group. We also performed a secondary exploratory analysis evaluating potential constructs that might influence the efficacy of the intervention.",The Testimonial-based Intervention on Drowning Prevention is a 36-min video consisting of four testi- monial stories about actual near-drowning experi- ences that occurred in rural China (see Supplementary Material for sample script).,Children in the com- parison group viewed a different 36-min testimonial video consisting of four testimonials on dog-bite pre- vention.

This study reports on a cluster RCT study with 50 Australian pre-school services to evaluate the effectiveness of the PRSIST Program for improving children’s self-regulation, executive function and school readiness, compared to current routine practice. ","All children in their final prior-to-school year in these centers, who attended at least one of the 1–2 assessment days, were invited to participate in this study. There were no further exclusion criteria. Parental consent to participate was provided for 547 3- 5-year old children, all of whom were identified as likely to be attending school in the subsequent year. The flow of participants throughout the study is depicted in Figure 1. At baseline, 473 of these children were assessed (86.5%), with non-participation largely due to absence on the day of assessment.","The Preschool Situational Self-Regulation Toolkit (PRSIST) Program aims to engage, challenge and extend young children’s self-regulation in ways that are playful, low-cost, routine, and target each of the aspects required for successful self-regulation (i.e., goal setting, motivation, problem solving, self-regulatory capacity). The PRSIST Program is a collection of professional learning, adult practices, play-based child activities, and home- based resources to support the development of children’s self- regulation. ","The control group continued with their existing program, which included structured and free play time. Given the prevalence of self-regulatory concern amongst ECEC educators, it is likely that some of these activities targeted self-regulation. Further, it is expected that at least some of the educators would have attended professional development during the trial, and some of this might have concerned self-regulation.

Participants were eligible if they were aged 20–60 years, were HIV-negative, and reported injecting drugs during the previous year. We randomly assigned participants (1:1; blocks of four) to either tenofovir or placebo using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. Participants chose either daily directly observed treatment or monthly visits and could switch at monthly visits. Participants received monthly HIV testing and individualised risk-reduction and adherence counselling, blood safety assessments every 3 months, and were off ered condoms and methadone treatment. The primary effi cacy endpoint was HIV infection, analysed by modifi ed intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00119106.","Between June 9, 2005, and July 22, 2010, we enrolled 2413 participants, assigning 1204 to tenofovir and 1209 to placebo. Two participants had HIV at enrolment and 50 became infected during follow-up: 17 in the tenofovir group (an incidence of 0·35 per 100 person-years) and 33 in the placebo group (0·68 per 100 person-years), indicating a 48·9% reduction in HIV incidence (95% CI 9·6–72·2; p=0·01). The occurrence of serious adverse events was much the same between the two groups (p=0·35). Nausea was more common in participants in the tenofovir group than in the placebo group (p=0·002). ","We randomly assigned participants in a one-to-one ratio to receive daily oral tenofovir 300 mg or placebo in blocks of four using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. The statistician who generated the sequence was not otherwise involved in the conduct of the trial, but was involved in the fi nal analysis. When a participant completed the consent process, study staff assigned them the next sequential randomisation number. Tenofovir and placebo tablets were similar in shape, colour, and taste. Participants and study staff were masked to drug assignment. Data were locked on Jan 18, 2013, at which point PAM and MM were unmasked (other investigators were unmasked individually as needed to help with the analysis).

","This program, known as Legacy for ChildrenTM (Legacy), was developed as a positive parenting program to promote child development by supporting sensitive, responsive parent-child relationships; building maternal self-efficacy; and fostering peer networks of support among mothers living in poverty.","In an effort to promote the health and developmental outcomes of children born into poverty, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conceptualized and designed the Legacy for ChildrenTM (Legacy) public health prevention model. This article examines the impact of Legacy on children’s cognitive and language development (intelligence quotient [IQ], achievement, language skills, and early reading skills) using both standardized assessments and parent-reported indictors through third grade.","The Legacy prevention program has been evaluated with a set of randomized controlled trials (ClinicalTrials.gov registry #: NCT00164697) at 2 intervention sites (LA and Miami). The 2 sites developed and implemented their own curricula around the 5 Legacy goals and core model components. The resulting interventions differed as a result of each site’s community, demographic and cultural characteristics, and intervention delivery factors informed by a full-length pilot assessment. Miami offered weekly parent group sessions from the target child’s birth to age 5 years; LA held 5 prenatal sessions and 9 blocks of 10- week sessions starting prenatally and ending when the child was 3 years old. The developmentally sequenced Legacy curricula cover themes such as discipline, attachment, developmental milestones, parenting stress management, establishment of goals and dreams for their children, and early literacy.","Data were collected from 2009 to 2014 from 541 mother-child dyads who were recruited into the 2 concurrent trials of Legacy for ChildrenTM at the University of Miami (n =277) and at the University of California Los Angeles (n = 264). Demographic characteristics of the Legacy intervention and sample population have been reported elsewhere.17 Eligibility criteria for both sites included that the mother’s age was 18 years or older and that she was comfortable speaking English, that she resided within the intervention catchment area, that she had received at least some prenatal care during her pregnancy with the target child, that she had custody of the target child, and that her income was below 200% of the federal poverty line at the time of recruitment. In Miami, mothers who were eligible for Medicaid, food stamps, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families were recruited from 2 hospitals within 72 hours of delivery of the target child. In Los Angeles (LA), expectant mothers were recruited prenatally from Women, Infants and Children clinics. Participants were randomized at a 3 (intervention) to 2 (comparison) ratio in order to guard against differential attrition from the treatment group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,Figure 1,"No, because experiments are listed together.

Participants were randomly assigned to a: 1) park walking group (N = 51), 2) relaxation exercises group (N = 46) and 3) control group (N = 56). The study was divided into two parts scheduled in spring (N = 83) and fall (N = 70).","After the common training session, the participants assigned to the park walking group took a guided walk on a predetermined route in the nearest park at a slow, low-intensity pace. They were asked to pay attention to their surroundings and to avoid discussion during this 15-minute walk. The trainers walked the route together with the group during the training and participants were given maps showing the route. In the intervention weeks they could walk either alone or in a group, but were encouraged not to talk to each other. Before and after the park walk participants reported their level of tension on paper.","We used two procedures in the relaxation training: 1) a release-only version of progressive muscle relaxation (Öst, 1987) and 2) a deep breathing and acceptance exercise developed by Tuomisto (2007). These methods were targeted at the most important elements in relaxation: muscle relaxation, deep and slow breathing, and acceptance of the here-and-now (Grossman et al., 2004; Hayes-Skelton, Usmani, Lee, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2012; McCallie et al., 2006). The release-only version of progressive relaxation targets primarily muscle relaxation and the deep breathing exploits the potential of the vagal (i.e., parasympathetic) influence on the autonomic nervous  14 system. This method was taught for one hour. The participants were advised that each relaxation session during the intervention period should last 15 minutes and they were given written relaxation instructions, too. Before and after each relaxation exercise, participants reported their level of tension on paper.","During the intervention weeks participants were instructed to engage for 15 minutes during their lunch break on working days (altogether 10 days) in one of the activities they were randomly assigned to, namely park walking, relaxation exercises, or usual break activities (control group).

Participants were then instructed to lean forward from the hip, with their spine in neutral until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh [36]. This position was held for 30 seconds, and then repeated 3 times (Figure 3). For the dynamic stretch (D), each participant was instructed to actively swing the leg to be stretched forward into hip flexion until a stretch was felt in the posterior thigh whilst keeping their knee extended and their ankle plantarflexed [35]. The leg was then allowed to swing back into slight hip extension. This was repeated for 30 seconds, such that the dynamic stretch consisted of repeated hip flexion/extension swinging movements (Figure 4). Both stretches were carried out for 30 seconds and repeated three times for each leg [28], to try to ensure that each individual carried out the same amount of stretching on both days.

In addition, the concentrations of fecal putrescine and serum spermidine in the Bifal+ Arg YG group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group.

","This study evaluated the impact of didactic videos and service user testimonial videos on mental illness stigma among medical students. Two randomized controlled trials were conducted in Nepal. Study 1 examined stigma reduction for depression. Study 2 examined depression and psychosis. Participants were Nepali medical students (Study 1: n = 94, Study 2: n = 213) randomized to three conditions: a didactic video based on the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), a service user video about living with mental illness, or a control condition with no videos. In Study 1, videos only addressed depression. In Study 2, videos addressed depression and psychosis. In Study 1, both didactic and service user videos reduced stigma compared to the control. In Study 2 (depression and psychosis), there were no differences among the three arms.","Study 1 was a pilot RCT with a mixed-methods approach conducted in 2017 with medical students at Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine (TU-IOM) in Kathmandu, Nepal. We employed a three-armed, parallel group RCT, and randomized participants to one of three conditions: a didactic video based on the mhGAP-IG module for depression; a service user testimonial video from a person who experienced depression; or a control featuring no video. For the mixed-methods component, we also included exploratory qualitative interviews with participants. At the time of this pilot, only the depression service user video had been completed, so the study was limited to depression.","Study 2 was a full RCT that evaluated the videos in a three-armed, parallel group RCT, in which medical students had an equal chance to be randomized to a service user testimonial video condition featuring lived experiences of depression and psychosis, didactic videos based on mhGAP-IG modules for depression and psychosis, or a control condition with no video.","Study 1 (depression only): The contents for all videos are presented in Table 1. All videos were 8 min in duration to have time matching between didactic and service user videos. The didactic video was adapted using existing mhGAP-IG materials from an ongoing study in Nepal: the Programme for Improving Mental Healthcare (PRIME) [37]. PRIME is a program used to evaluate the implementation of mental health in primary care in five countries, including Nepal [38]. Materials were already adapted and translated for Nepali healthcare settings in PRIME. We reduced the content delivered in the PRIME training package about depression to an 8 min video and collaborated with a local mhGAP-IG trainer who is a Nepali psychiatrist to narrate the video in Nepali. The content follows the mhGAP-IG depression module.","A service user video was produced in collaboration with the Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers (RESHAPE) initiative in Nepal. RESHAPE is a program in which service users treated through PRIME are trained in PhotoVoice participatory techniques to develop recovery narratives, which they use to co-facilitate mental health training for health workers [33–36]. The service user in this video was selected based on her previous success of co-facilitating mental health training in RESHAPE. The script for the video was based on the narrative prepared by the service user for her PhotoVoice testimonial. During video editing, the research team selected specific content from the testimonial that matched the content of the didactic video. Additional perspectives from a health worker who diagnosed the service user and a counselor who treated her were interwoven with the testimonial to produce the final 8 min video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"Study 2 (depression and psychosis): The didactic and service user testimonial videos developed for depression in Study 1 were also used in Study 2. In addition, didactic and service user videos were developed for psychosis. The psychosis didactic video, like the one about depression, was adapted from the mhGAP-IG psychosis module used in PRIME in Nepal. The same Nepali psychiatrist who narrated the depression video also narrated the psychosis one for consistency. The service user testimonial video about psychosis was delivered by a service user who received treatment through PRIME. Due to stigma and family shame, finding a service user who was willing to speak about psychosis on video was more challenging than finding someone for depression. A person was eventually identified, and she, alongside her family members and a counselor, produced the narrative video with the research team. Because both the 8 min psychosis and 8 min depression content were included, the total duration of videos in both the didactic and service user arms was 16 min in Study 2. The service users for both the depression and psychosis videos were women 20–30 years of age.","After review of 2nd and 3rd year MBBS student rosters, 18 students were excluded prior to randomization because of being international students not speaking Nepali or having already completed their psychiatry rotation. Among the remaining students, 100 were selected for randomization to one of the three arms. No potential participants refused to participate in this study. An additional six students were excluded at the time of analysis because information on their demographic forms revealed that they were international students whose native language was not Nepali or they had completed their clinical psychiatry rotation; this information had not been up to date in the class rosters at the time of randomization (Figure 1). One participant in the service user arm was excluded because of both being an international non-Nepali student and having completed a psychiatry rotation. Demographic characteristics of these participants are in Table 2. Of note, only three participants indicated that they were primarily interested psychiatry as a specialty (see Figure 2). Participants were randomized into one the three conditions: the control group with no video (n = 31, 33%), the didactic video group (n = 31, 33%), and the service user recovery testimonial video group (n = 32; 34%).","For the second study, 248 students were enrolled in first- and second-year MBBS program across the two institutions participating. From roster, 28 students were excluded because of being international or having completed a psychiatry clinical rotation. The remaining 220 students were randomized; however, seven students declined to participate or were unavailable during data collection periods. Therefore, 213 participants were randomly allocated to the following arms: didactic video condition (n = 73), the service user video condition (n = 72), and the no video control condition (n = 75) (Figure 3). At the analysis phase, there were additional exclusions because of missing data or identification of exclusion criteria that was not recorded in the school registers. Participant characteristics for each condition are shown in Table 4.","The intervention was a single session that lasted approximately one hour for participants to provide informed consent, complete a demographic form, watch videos relevant to their study arm, complete the assessments, and be debriefed. Participants in either of the video groups stayed for the full hour, but participants in the control condition who did not watch the video finished in about 50 min. In Study 2, which included two 8 min videos with diagnostic accuracy for both conditions, the protocol required an additional 15 min. Survey data were collected using SurveyCTO (Ver 2.30, Dobility, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), an android application, on tablets (www.surveycto.com/accessed on: 19 June 2017). In Study 1, after completion of the video session, participants were invited to participate in the optional qualitative interview to be held within one week.","Figure 1, Figure 3",,2,6,,,,

","A pot experiment was conducted to study the effect of phosphorus and sulphur nutrients as sole and in combination from organic and integration of organic and inorganic sources on groundnut quality. Two studies were conducted to select best phosphorus and sulphur sources by using farmyard manure, poultry manure (PM), vermicompost and sewage sludge. There were six treatments in study one and two, including inorganic source of single super phosphate (SSP) and no phosphorus (control) in trial one and no sulphur (control) in trial two. They were replicated four times in a completely randomized design. Among them the selected best source poultry manure was combined with chemical fertilizer (CF) single super phosphate to supply phosphorus and sulphur by having six treatments (Control, 100%PM, 75%PM + 25%CF, 50%PM + 50%CF, 25%PM + 75% CF, 100% CF) and were replicated three times in a completely randomized design. The oil and protein content of kernels were increased as a result of phosphorus and sulphur. Poultry manure as a sole source of phosphorus and sulphur exhibited the highest oil and protein content. 25% poultry manure with 75% chemical fertilizer as a combination exhibited the highest oil content (45.20%) and 75% poultry manure with 25% chemical fertilizer as a combination resulted in the highest protein content (12.50%) of kernels.","There were three sets of studies, one on phosphorus sources, one on sulphur sources and the third on integration of phosphorus and sulphur through organic and inorganic sources.","In sole phosphorus and sulphur sources there were four organic sources (farmyard manure, poultry manure, vermicompost and sewage sludge) evaluated in comparison with the standard inorganic source of single superphosphate, all applied on equal P basis at 34 kg P2O5 ha-1 (in the phosphorus study) and on equal S basis at 75 kg S ha-1 (in the sulphur study).

Five further patients were removed from the trial because of anaemia (PCV < 0·30) developing in the first week, 12 patients defaulted after only the first or second visit to the antenatal clinic, and one was found to be mentally subnormal and unable to follow instructions. These 18 patients were replaced in the trial by others; this was arranged by a moderator (Dr. B. M. Greenwood), who was not otherwise involved in the research, but had access to the treatment allocation code for this purpose. The five treatment groups, of 40 subjects each, received oral chloroquine sulphate and proguanil tablets (ICI) and spansules containing ferrous sulphate and folic acid (Smith, Kline and French), following the schedules shown in Table 2: the manufacturers supplied active tablets or spansules and the placebos*, which could not be distinguished by sight. The patients were instructed to bring any unconsumed medication to the clinic at every visit, so allowing for some check on their compliance to instructions.","The first ten successive patients were included in a pilot study: they were treated in exactly the same manner as the patients in the study, except that all received the treatment ofgroup 5 (Table 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,1,5,,,,

","We present results from six randomized control trials of an integrated approach to improve livelihoods amongst the very poor. The approach combines the transfer of a productive asset with consumption support, training and coaching plus savings encouragement and health education and/or services. Results from the implementation of the same basic program, adapted to a wide variety of geographic and institutional contexts and with multiple implementing partners, show statistically significant, cost- effective impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by increases in self-employment income) and psychosocial status of the targeted households. The impact on the poor households lasted at least a year after all implementation ended. It is possible to make sustainable improvements in the economic status of the poor with a relatively short-term intervention.","Between 2007 and 2014, we conducted a multi-site RCT of the Graduation program. The sites were chosen as part of an effort led by Ford Foundation and Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), referred to here as the Graduation Program Consortium. The programs were implemented by six different organizations in six countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru), but overall planning on the programs and evaluation were coordinated from the onset.1 Treatment was randomly assigned amongst eligible households. Data were collected at baseline and just after program end, two years after the programs began (“endline 1”), and again approximately one year after the end of the programs, i.e., about three years after treatment began (“endline 2”). We report pooled results from all the sites (21,063adults in 10,495 households) as well as site by site results.","In all sites but one, the experimental design was strictly adhered to: no control received the program, and all treatment households received the program. The India site was the only site in which some individuals refused participation: 52% of those selected in the randomization participated in the program. According to Bandhan, the implementing organization, 35% of households declined the offer, for two unrelated reasons: first, in some villages, a section of villagers held the (erroneous) belief that Bandhan was a Christian organization trying to convert beneficiaries, and acceptance of the livestock constituted agreeing in some way to participating in Christian rituals. Second, some wives were worried that their husband would mishandle the asset and they would lose face in front of their village. A further 13% were deemed ineligible by Bandhan because they were participating in microcredit or self-help group activities. The analysis below is an “intention to treat”: we compare households assigned to control to those assigned to treatment, irrespective of whether they received treatment or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,6,12,,,,

","This study examined whether treatment with imipramine or treatment with Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) reduces the connectivity within dynamic networks of mental states in individuals with depressive symptoms. In the Imipramine trial, individuals diagnosed with major depression were randomized to imipramine treatment or placebo-pill treatment (n = 50).  In the Mind-Maastricht trial, individuals with residual depressive symptoms were randomized to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or to a waiting-list control condition (n = 119).","The flow of participants in the two studies is presented in Figs 1 and 2. In the Imipramine trial, 49 of the 63 randomized participants completed 6 weeks of treatment (for details, see previous papers14,15) and 50 of the 63 randomized participants provided ESM data at baseline and post-inter- vention and thus were included in the present analyses. In the Mind-Maastricht trial, 3 of the 130 randomized participants discontinued study participation (for details, see previous paper16) and 119 of the 130 randomized participants provided ESM data at baseline and post-intervention and were included in the analyses. Participants in the MBCT group reported practicing for 30.3 minutes (SD = 11.2) per day on average. Mindfulness practice was calculated as minutes spent on long formal exercises. In addition to the formal meditation exercises, partici- pants reported to have engaged in informal meditation exercises (such as the 3-minute breathing space) 2.2 times a day on average (SD = 1.0).
","Participants in the Imipramine trial received either twice daily imipramine (200 mg per day) or placebo (4 capsules per day) for 6 weeks. In case of intolerance, the dose was decreased to either 100 mg of imipramine per day or 2 placebo capsules per day. Both patients and the assessors of the primary outcomes were blinded to the type of treatment patients received. After 6 weeks, the treatment could be prolonged to 18 weeks.","Patients in the Mind-Maastricht trial were randomized to either an 8-week MBCT group program or to an 8-week waiting-list control condition. After the post-intervention assessment, participants in the control condi- tion had the opportunity to take part in an MBCT program. MBCT consisted of eight weekly group sessions of 2.5 hr and homework assignments of 30 to 60 minutes a day. The MBCT sessions followed the MBCT guidelines of Segal and colleagues24. The sessions covered meditation exercises (e.g., body-scan, sitting meditation), yoga exercises, and discussion of the exercises and homework assignments.","All participants provided written informed consent for study participation. The inclusion cri- teria of the Imipramine trial and the Mind-Maastricht trial differed from each other as both trials were conducted independently of each other. The inclusion criteria of the Imipramine trial were: age between 18 and 65 years, a DSM-IV diagnosis of current major depressive disorder, a score of ≥18 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)23, a score of ≥4 on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), no current use of psycho- tropic medications, and no diagnosis of a major medical disorder. In the original trial, 63 patients with a diag- nosis of major depressive disorder were recruited from primary care practices. In the current study, participants who had completed ESM assessments both at baseline and after treatment with imipramine (n = 23) or placebo (n = 27) were included in the analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,Analyses of the current study included patients with ESM assessments at baseline and after MBCT (n = 57) or after the wait- ing period (n = 62).,,,,"Figure 1, Figure 2",Y,2,4,,,,

","Abstract—Context. Mindfulness is a meditation technique whose main goal is keeping the mind calm and educating attention by focusing only on one thing at a time, usually breathing. The reported benefits of its continued practice can be of interest for Software Engineering students and practitioners, especially in tasks like conceptual modeling, in which concentration and clearness of mind are crucial. Goal. In order to evaluate whether Software Engineering students enhance their conceptual modeling performance after several weeks of mindfulness practice, a series of three controlled experiments were carried out at the University of Seville during three consecutive academic years (2013–2016) involving 130 students. Method. In all the experiments, the subjects were divided into two groups. While the experimental group practiced mindfulness, the control group was trained in public speaking as a placebo treatment. All the subjects developed two conceptual models based on a transcript of an interview, one before and another one after the treatment. The results were compared in terms of conceptual modeling quality (measured as effectiveness, i.e. the percentage of model elements correctly identified) and productivity (measured as efficiency, i.e. the number of model elements correctly identified per unit of time). Results. The statistically significant results of the series of experiments revealed that the subjects who practiced mindfulness developed slightly better conceptual models (their quality was 8.16% higher) and they did it faster (they were 46.67% more productive) than the control group, even if they did not have a previous interest in meditation. Conclusions. The practice of mindfulness improves the performance of Software Engineering students in conceptual modeling, especially their productivity. Nevertheless, more experimentation is needed in order to confirm the outcomes in other Software Engineering tasks and populations.","In order to answer these research questions, an itera- tive process which consisted of a baseline experiment and two internal replications was carried out during the first semesters of the 2013–2014 [17], 2014–2015 [18] and 2015– 2016 academic years. ","For the sake of readability, the baseline experiment and the two internal replications are referred to as MIND#1, MIND#2 and MIND#3 respectively in the rest of the article.","In the mindfulness workshops, the sessions were face– to–face, four days a week. All the sessions followed the same dynamics: the students and the researcher responsible for conducting the session met in a classroom; they all sat down, lights were turned off and curtains were drawn letting only some dim light in the room; when they all were in silence, an alarm was programmed; during the first five minutes, the subjects were guided in their body scan; then, during the remaining time, they were invited to focus solely on their breathing. Sometimes, the researcher asked “where is your mind now?” in order to re–focus them on breathing. In the event some students were late, they were instructed to enter the room making as less noise as possible and sit on one of the chairs that were intentionally left empty near the door.","In the public speaking workshops, the subjects were given some basic guidelines on how to prepare a talk, some notions on non–verbal communication and some seminal talks were commented. Later, they were invited to look for related videos on the Internet and to prepare a script for a public presentation on a topic of their interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"The result of applying changes CH1 to CH3 in MIND#2 resulted in its differential settings consisting of a random assignment of subjects to groups, a postponed public speak- ing workshop, i.e. a null treatment for the control group, and a mindfulness workshop extended to 6 weeks with 12– minute sessions. All the other experiment settings were the same as in MIND#1.","In spite of the outcomes of MIND#2 regarding design ques- tions DQ1 (students’ motivation), DQ2 (placebo control con- dition) and DQ3 (duration of treatment), we decided to keep changes CH1 to CH3 in the experiment protocol in order to confirm the obtained results in the second replication.","To answer this question, we decided to extend the mindfulness workshop from 4 to 6 weeks and sessions from 10 to 12 minutes in future replications (see CH3 in Table 6). With respect to the number of weeks, it was limited not only by the required lessons on conceptual modeling so the students could perform the exercises, but also by the Christmas break, which would interrupt the mindfulness sessions. Therefore, the maximum number of weeks was limited to six weeks, from week 6 to week 11 (see Figure 3). Regarding the duration of mind- fulness sessions, we were limited by the 20–minute recess between lessons. Considering that students had to come to the meditation room and go back to their classrooms, mindfulness sessions had to be shorter than 15 minutes.",,None,,3,6,,,,

","Using a randomized controlled design, we evaluated a testimonial-based intervention to reduce drowning risk among 280 3rd- and 4th-grade rural Chinese children. Children were randomly assigned to view either testimonials on drowning risk (intervention) or dog-bite risk (control). Safety knowledge and perceived vulnerability were measured by self-report questionnaires, and simulated behaviors in and near water were assessed with a culturally appro- priate dollhouse task.","Power analysis was performed a priori and minimum sample size calculated based on the following proce- dure. An estimated effect size of d 1⁄4 0.33 for the inter- vention effect was determined based on results from a similar video-based intervention study of playground safety in Canada (Morrongiello & Matheis, 2007b). It was determined that 76 participants in total would be required to detect the expected effect of the main out- comes between the intervention and comparison groups with a power of 0.99 (two tails, a 1⁄4 .01) using G*Power 3.1; our anticipated sample from any single elementary school in rural China was much larger.","The present study used a randomized repeated mea- sures intervention-control design (allocation ratio 1:1 with no changes in design after trial commencement) to evaluate the efficacy of a testimonial-based video intervention on reducing drowning risk among school-aged children in rural China. We hypothesized that children in the intervention group who watched the testimonials would obtain higher scores on safety knowledge, perceived vulnerability, and simulated behaviors around water than those in the comparison group. We also performed a secondary exploratory analysis evaluating potential constructs that might influence the efficacy of the intervention.",The Testimonial-based Intervention on Drowning Prevention is a 36-min video consisting of four testi- monial stories about actual near-drowning experi- ences that occurred in rural China (see Supplementary Material for sample script).,Children in the com- parison group viewed a different 36-min testimonial video consisting of four testimonials on dog-bite pre- vention. Those testimonials were created to be of the same length and structure as the drowning testimo- nials and therefore offer a comparable active control group.

The study started in October 2007 and completed follow up in May 2008.","This study was powered to provide initial safety data for the use of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel with CPG 7909 in an adult population living in a malaria endemic area. A group size of 10 volunteers per dose give a probability of 0.80 for detecting one or more AEs that occurred with a frequency of 0.15 per volunteer; we included 12 per group in case of withdrawals or loss to follow-up. Thus, a total of 24 volunteers were enrolled (12 in the Alum and 12 in the Alum+CPG group).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,"Could say that the initial sample size was 10, based on the power analysis",,,,,,,,None,,1,2,,,,

","The Preschool Situational Self-Regulation Toolkit (PRSIST) Program was developed as a low-cost and embedded approach for educators to foster pre-schoolers’ self- regulation and related abilities (e.g., executive function, school readiness). This study reports on a cluster RCT study with 50 Australian pre-school services to evaluate the effectiveness of the PRSIST Program for improving children’s self-regulation, executive function and school readiness, compared to current routine practice. ","All children in their final prior-to-school year in these centers, who attended at least one of the 1–2 assessment days, were invited to participate in this study. There were no further exclusion criteria. Parental consent to participate was provided for 547 3- 5-year old children, all of whom were identified as likely to be attending school in the subsequent year. The flow of participants throughout the study is depicted in Figure 1. At baseline, 473 of these children were assessed (86.5%), with non-participation largely due to absence on the day of assessment.","The Preschool Situational Self-Regulation Toolkit (PRSIST) Program aims to engage, challenge and extend young children’s self-regulation in ways that are playful, low-cost, routine, and target each of the aspects required for successful self-regulation (i.e., goal setting, motivation, problem solving, self-regulatory capacity). The PRSIST Program is a collection of professional learning, adult practices, play-based child activities, and home- based resources to support the development of children’s self- regulation. ","The control group continued with their existing program, which included structured and free play time. Given the prevalence of self-regulatory concern amongst ECEC educators, it is likely that some of these activities targeted self-regulation. Further, it is expected that at least some of the educators would have attended professional development during the trial, and some of this might have concerned self-regulation. However, all of this can be considered current routine practice and represents an appropriately active control condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,Figure 2,,1,2,,,,

","This program, known as Legacy for ChildrenTM (Legacy), was developed as a positive parenting program to promote child development by supporting sensitive, responsive parent-child relationships; building maternal self-efficacy; and fostering peer networks of support among mothers living in poverty.","In an effort to promote the health and developmental outcomes of children born into poverty, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conceptualized and designed the Legacy for ChildrenTM (Legacy) public health prevention model. This article examines the impact of Legacy on children’s cognitive and language development (intelligence quotient [IQ], achievement, language skills, and early reading skills) using both standardized assessments and parent-reported indictors through third grade.","The Legacy prevention program has been evaluated with a set of randomized controlled trials (ClinicalTrials.gov registry #: NCT00164697) at 2 intervention sites (LA and Miami). The 2 sites developed and implemented their own curricula around the 5 Legacy goals and core model components. The resulting interventions differed as a result of each site’s community, demographic and cultural characteristics, and intervention delivery factors informed by a full-length pilot assessment. Miami offered weekly parent group sessions from the target child’s birth to age 5 years; LA held 5 prenatal sessions and 9 blocks of 10- week sessions starting prenatally and ending when the child was 3 years old. The developmentally sequenced Legacy curricula cover themes such as discipline, attachment, developmental milestones, parenting stress management, establishment of goals and dreams for their children, and early literacy.","Data were collected from 2009 to 2014 from 541 mother-child dyads who were recruited into the 2 concurrent trials of Legacy for ChildrenTM at the University of Miami (n =277) and at the University of California Los Angeles (n = 264). Demographic characteristics of the Legacy intervention and sample population have been reported elsewhere.17 Eligibility criteria for both sites included that the mother’s age was 18 years or older and that she was comfortable speaking English, that she resided within the intervention catchment area, that she had received at least some prenatal care during her pregnancy with the target child, that she had custody of the target child, and that her income was below 200% of the federal poverty line at the time of recruitment. In Miami, mothers who were eligible for Medicaid, food stamps, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families were recruited from 2 hospitals within 72 hours of delivery of the target child. In Los Angeles (LA), expectant mothers were recruited prenatally from Women, Infants and Children clinics.

The trainers walked the route together with the group during the training and participants were given maps showing the route. In the intervention weeks they could walk either alone or in a group, but were encouraged not to talk to each other. Before and after the park walk participants reported their level of tension on paper.","We used two procedures in the relaxation training: 1) a release-only version of progressive muscle relaxation (Öst, 1987) and 2) a deep breathing and acceptance exercise developed by Tuomisto (2007). These methods were targeted at the most important elements in relaxation: muscle relaxation, deep and slow breathing, and acceptance of the here-and-now (Grossman et al., 2004; Hayes-Skelton, Usmani, Lee, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2012; McCallie et al., 2006). The release-only version of progressive relaxation targets primarily muscle relaxation and the deep breathing exploits the potential of the vagal (i.e., parasympathetic) influence on the autonomic nervous  14 system. This method was taught for one hour. The participants were advised that each relaxation session during the intervention period should last 15 minutes and they were given written relaxation instructions, too. Before and after each relaxation exercise, participants reported their level of tension on paper.","During the intervention weeks participants were instructed to engage for 15 minutes during their lunch break on working days (altogether 10 days) in one of the activities they were randomly assigned to, namely park walking, relaxation exercises, or usual break activities (control group). ","The first RCT took place in spring (starting in week 18) and the second identical RCT in fall 2014 (starting in week 35). Thus, the second RCT in fall was a replication of the RCT in spring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,2,6,,,,

","We conducted a single-stage, randomized controlled trial with equal allocation to each of four study arms: Arm 1 (Control Arm), Arm 2 (Bot/VPN Check), Arm 3 (Truthfulness/Attention Check), and Arm 4 (Stringent Arm -All Checks).",'-Arm 1 was a control arm that contained no additional quality-control procedures beyond the standard eligibility requirements (see Participants). -Arm 2 was a bot/VPN check that asked participants to select the telephone number they call in the event of an emergency and to correctly identify a drawn image of an eggplant.,'-Arm 3 was a truthfulness/attention check that asked participants if they had done business with Latveria (a country that exists only in the Marvel Comic Universe) and then required them to pass two attention-check questions.,-Arm 4 was a stringent arm that combined the checks from Arms 2 and 3.,"Sample size We recruited 1100 participants (with replacement in some arms, see Design). Our a priori power analysis indicated that using a fixed effects ANOVA to detect an overall difference in means between four study arms, this sample would allow detection of a difference with effect size f = 0.10 (F = 2.61) at power 0.80, two-tailed alpha 0.05. With equal allocation, each arm was planned to have 275 subjects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation,,,,,,,,,"Crowdsourced psychological and other biobehavioral research using platforms like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is increasingly common – but has proliferated more rapidly than studies to establish data quality best practices.
